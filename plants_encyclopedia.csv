"Wodyetia bifurcata","Foxtail Palm","Palms","One of the most frequently used palms across all designs. Self-cleaning, large tropical silhouette. Available in singles, doubles, and triples. Used as anchor trees and tall backdrop palms. Naturally taller than King Alexander palms. Often paired with Kentopsis palms in alternating rows to create varied height lines."
"Phoenix roebelenii","Pygmy Date Palm","Palms","Short, bushy understory palm reaching 10-12 feet. Kept natural and full rather than heavily trimmed. Triples preferred. Creates a soft, palmy, bushy privacy buffer. Only trimmed twice a year. Brought in at 25-gallon size when half-grown. Flanks centerpiece trees and adds intermediate height."
"Archontophoenix alexandrae","King Alexander Palm","Palms","Called 'the king of palms.' Self-cleaning with gorgeous V-shape in doubles. Beautiful long fronds. Petite compared to foxtails — used as intermediate trees. Perfect in front of windows. Comes in singles, doubles, triples, quads. Doubles are the favorite for flat surfaces and front entrances."
"Bismarckia nobilis","Bismarck Palm","Palms","Massive silver/blue centerpiece palm. Stunning and large. Used as a dramatic focal tree. Needs plenty of room — the fronds spread wide. Not to be crowded by other large plants. Silver tone becomes more pronounced with age."
"Veitchia montgomeryana","Montgomery Palm","Palms","Smooth-trunked tropical palm used as tall backdrop trees. Comes in doubles and triples. Gorgeous when mature. Paired with backing plants like lady palms. Used as inherited specimens that integrate well into new landscape designs."
"Phoenix sylvestris","Sylvester Palm (Silver Date Palm)","Palms","Big statement palm with diamond-patterned trunk. Offers tremendous visual punch — few single trees match its impact.

"Chamaerops humilis","European Fan Palm","Palms","Extremely slow-growing fan palm — takes 20 years to get real size. Completely different structure and look from feather palms. Ideal as a centerpiece in front of windows or blank walls. Trunks can be softened with base plantings. Fronds loved but trunks less so — solved by planting ground cover around the base."
"Livistona chinensis","Chinese Fan Palm","Palms","Beautiful fan fronds. Offers a botanical garden aesthetic. Nice, clean palms that reflect light beautifully. Found at botanical gardens and used to create that curated tropical look."
"Caryota mitis","Clustering Fishtail Palm","Palms","One of the designer's favorites. Dark green clustering palm excellent for privacy walls. Plant 6 feet off the house minimum. 30-gallon size recommended for immediate impact. Reaches 27-30 feet over time. Makes fantastic living walls when planted in rows. Not for pool enclosures due to spread. Creates lush, dense green backdrop."

Used alternating with foxtails to create varied height lines. Ideal for creating that botanical garden feel. A conversation starter."
"Ravenala madagascariensis","Traveler's Palm","Palms","Not actually a palm — related to bananas and birds of paradise. Flat fan shape that's architecturally stunning. Gets very large, so needs space. Used as a dramatic backdrop. Takes a couple extra days of water establishment. Creates instant tropical drama."

Handles temperatures above 32°F. A true focal point tree."

"Copernicia fallaensis","Copernicia Palm (Cuban Wax Palm)","Palms","Rare Cuban fan palm — a standout feature tree. Silver-toned fronds that grow more silver with age. Extremely slow-growing (about 1-1.5 feet per year). Compact, vertical crown with overlapping fronds. Heavier crown than trunk can support initially, so must be staked. A stunner at any size. Often mistaken for Bismarck. One palm that makes a complete impact on its own."
"Parajubaea torallyi (or P. cocoides)","Cold Hardy Coconut (Alfred Palm)","Palms","Super slow-growing palm that can eventually get very large — the specimen shown was 20 years old. Available from 15-gallon up to field-grown. A long-term investment palm. Worth the wait despite extremely slow growth."
"Rhapis excelsa","Lady Palm (Rhapis Palm)","Palms","Shade-tolerant clustering palm with distinctive fan-shaped leaves. Clumps at the base and spreads via pups.

"Aechmea blanchetiana (or Aechmea 'Silver Vase')","Silver Odora Bromeliad","Bromeliads","Large canopy bromeliad — 15-gallon plants available. Root ball can be cut down dramatically because bromeliads don't rely heavily on root systems. Epiphytic nature means minimal root ball is needed for planting."
"Neoregelia 'Fireball'","Fireball Bromeliad","Bromeliads","Red/fire-colored small bromeliad ideal for mounting on trees. Best mounted with fence staples rather than ribbon, which stretches and loosens. Favorite method is to mount at a slight angle for drainage."

Seen throughout the Florida Keys. Can be maintained at any height."
