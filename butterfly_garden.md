# Butterfly & Pollinator Garden Plant List

**Source:** True Gardener YouTube Channel (Jennifer Bevans, Landscape Designer, Vero Beach / Treasure Coast / Space Coast FL, Zone 10A, 25+ years experience)

**Design Philosophy:** Jennifer acknowledges that butterfly gardens naturally tend toward a "cottagey," chaotic look. Her approach is to marry her clean, defined, tiered design style with the looseness of butterfly plantings -- maintaining drift patterns, layered levels, and defined borders while allowing the butterfly plants their natural fullness. She uses non-blooming structural plants (e.g., Blaze Copperleaf, Gold Mound, Coontie Palms) as dividers and border hedges between butterfly plantings to create visual order within the garden.

## The Top 10 Butterfly/Pollinator Plants

Explicitly listed and numbered by Jennifer during a Merritt Island, FL butterfly garden tour. The garden contained 10 different varieties of butterfly plants.

### 1. Red Hibiscus
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds
- **Native Status:** Non-native (tropical)
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Size:** 4-6 ft is the "sweet spot"; let them grow to get maximum blooms (keeping them cut below 3 ft makes them woody with fewer blooms)
- **Design Notes:** Used as a rear wall planting, clustered in groups of 8 at 1.5-2 ft on center in staggered/triangle formations. Creates a "colorful bright red and green wall" as a backdrop. Double Peach, Red, and Pink varieties are her favorites for durability. Blooms attract all kinds of pollinators.

### 2. Blue My Mind (Evolvulus)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds -- "they love, love, love Blue My Minds"
- **Native Status:** Non-native (Florida-friendly)
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun; tolerates heat off pavement
- **Size:** Low ground cover
- **Design Notes:** Used as a carpet/border flower throughout the garden. Planted in drifts and swaths along front edges. Likes it dry, works planted in stone/paver borders. Compact and low-growing. Stays condensed. Fantastic attractant. Can be used as alternative border alongside Anmarie Lantana and Society Garlic. NOTE: Rabbits love to eat them; Anmarie Lantana is a good rabbit-resistant substitute.

### 3. Dwarf Hot Pink Pentas
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds -- "big, big butterfly attracted"
- **Native Status:** Non-native (African origin)
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun preferred; CAN bloom in shade (one of the few butterfly plants that does)
- **Size:** Dwarf variety stays chunky and full, not tall and leggy; approx. 2-3 ft
- **Bloom Season:** All spring, all summer, and into fall (approx. 8-10 months)
- **Design Notes:** Used in clusters of 5-6, then broken with a non-blooming plant for continuous color effect. Trim them with hard cuts to keep compact -- don't skip pruning just because they are blooming. The dwarf variety is preferred over tall/leggy standard pentas. Brazilian Red Cloaks are a great color companion with matching pink tones. Jennifer uses small dabs/clusters, not big sweeps.

### 4. Yellow African Iris (Dietes bicolor)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, pollinators
- **Native Status:** Non-native (South African origin)
- **Sun Requirements:** Sun to partial sun
- **Size:** Vertical, soft habit; blooms gorgeous delicate yellow flowers
- **Bloom Season:** Spring through summer
- **Design Notes:** Great in front of windows because of vertical habit -- won't block views. Maintenance: trim hanging/drooping stocks at base every 3 months, keeping it like a bouquet of flowers. Can cut all the way to ground once a year if needed; flush regrowth. Very low-maintenance plant.

### 5. Sapphire Duranta (Duranta erecta)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies -- "pop a couple of these in your garden, they will absolutely come flocking to them"
- **Native Status:** Non-native
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Size:** 4-5 ft tall (can be kept ball-shaped with pruning or left to look like "firecrackers")
- **Design Notes:** Available as bushes or trees; Jennifer prefers the tree form because it is easier to manage given their natural sprawling habit. Wild, sporadic bloom at branch edges is stunning. Works well with tropical gardens. Has a "firecracker" look when allowed to open up at 4-5 ft. Requires quite a bit of trimming to keep condensed/ball-shaped.

### 6. Anmarie Lantana (Lantana camara 'Anne Marie')
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds -- "everybody loves Lantana"
- **Native Status:** Non-native; sterile variety (NOT the invasive/trailing native type)
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun; loves heat; summer-bound
- **Size:** 1.5-2 ft; clumping, not spreading
- **Design Notes:** Sterile variety is strongly recommended over the native/trailing type which becomes invasive. Compact, mounding habit. Plant in groups of 6-8 for thick coverage. Offers confetti-like mix of red, yellow, and pink blooms. Not typically on the menu for rabbits (good alternative to Blue My Mind in rabbit-heavy areas). In the Anmarie/sterile Lantana family, yellow-and-white-toned varieties also available. Can handle harsh afternoon sun and heat. 10 months of blooms per year. Slightly toxic to animals (especially cows), so keep contained.

### 7. Dwarf Firebush (Hamelia patens var. dwarf)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds, AND hummingbirds -- "this plant is a hummingbird attractant by far"
- **Native Status:** NOT the native variety (the dwarf is a cultivar). Native firebush also exists and is phenomenal for pollinators but grows 6-7 ft uncontrollably. Jennifer prefers the dwarf for design control.
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun to filtered light
- **Size:** Can be kept at 3 ft (truly dwarf-manageable) but will grow to 10-12 ft if left unpruned; 4-5 ft is a typical maintained size
- **Bloom Season:** 10-12 months per year, including winter blooms; gorgeous red-orange flowers
- **Design Notes:** Jennifer's favorite variety for controllability. Unlike the native firebush (which has a mind of its own at 6-7 ft), the dwarf can be kept dense from top to bottom at any desired height. Used as rear backdrop plantings, fence buffer perimeters, or side-island layering. Has been used to create full backyard perimeter buffers for butterfly/bird lovers. Stays green and continues to bloom even when kept small.

### 8. Yellow Lantana Tree (Lantana standard)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds, pollinators
- **Native Status:** Non-native; sterile variety recommended
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Size:** Tree form (standard/lollipop shape)
- **Design Notes:** Tree-form lantana adds vertical interest and height variation in the butterfly garden. The sterile/compact varieties are preferred -- they stay put and don't trail or become invasive. Blooms beautiful yellow and white. An "adorable" accent tree in the butterfly garden.

### 9. Mimosa Tree / Powderpuff Tree (Calliandra)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, birds
- **Native Status:** Non-native (Florida-friendly)
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun; sunniest spots preferred
- **Size:** Bush variety is multi-stemmed; tree variety has single dominant leader trunk. Gets 5-6 ft range and opens/branches out. Can get up to 20 ft wide if allowed.
- **Bloom Season:** All summer; pink powderpuff blooms
- **Design Notes:** Available in pink variety (Jennifer's choice). The bush variety and tree variety have different growth habits. Used as a backdrop plant behind shorter butterfly plants. Can be kept compact "forever" or allowed to spread. Gives an "Asian style" mushroom-top effect as it matures. Disguises milkweed and other less-attractive host plants tucked behind it.

### 10. Milkweed (Asclepias)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies (host plant for caterpillars/monarchs); this is where butterflies lay eggs and caterpillars feed
- **Native Status:** Native
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Size:** Varies by variety
- **Preferred Variety:** Golden Rod / Yellow milkweed -- "I think it's just the prettiest of the variety"
- **Design Notes:** Jennifer's approach is to HIDE milkweed in the back of the garden. "I stick them in the back. I know they have a purpose. I know they have a goal in life, but I stick them in the back." Place milkweed in sunny spots that are not prominently visible. Butterflies will hover around the milkweed, but what visitors see from the front is butterflies, not the messy host plants. Tuck behind trees, larger shrubs, or in rear corners. A study from the University of Michigan showed that healthy, well-fertilized milkweed resists pest damage (99% of pests attacked unhealthy milkweed vs. 1% on healthy plants) -- so fertilize your milkweed.

## Bonus Trees for the Butterfly Garden

Jennifer notes: "If you count the trees -- and of course everything winged loves trees -- the orchid tree and the bottle brush tree and the vines, all of that can also be included."

### Hong Kong Orchid Tree (Bauhinia blakeana)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, pollinators
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Bloom:** Beautiful purple/contrasting blooms; goes in and out of season with growth flushes
- **Design Notes:** Stunning accent tree in the butterfly garden. Provides a contrasting purple bloom against the reds and pinks of the other plantings.

### Bottlebrush Tree (Callistemon, standard/lollipop form)
- **Attracts:** Birds, butterflies, hummingbirds
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Bloom Season:** All year long but especially spring and early summer
- **Size:** Compact standard form with single dominant leader; head can be kept small or allowed to double in size
- **Design Notes:** Used as a centerpiece tree in smaller island beds near walkways. Gorgeous red blooms are a magnet for winged visitors. Lollipop shape makes it ideal for tight spaces.

### Anderson Crepe Hibiscus (white variety)
- **Attracts:** Hummingbirds especially
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Bloom:** Delicate white blooms that look like a rain tree; rarer than the pink variety
- **Design Notes:** Mentioned as a hummingbird magnet.

## Bonus Vines & Additional Pollinator Plants

### Railroad Vine (Ipomoea pes-caprae)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies (host plant -- caterpillars feed on it)
- **Native Status:** Native to Florida
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Design Notes:** A major butterfly host plant. Jennifer showed caterpillars actively feeding on these vines. The caterpillars cocoon on the leaves, mimicking the leaf shape. Blooms gorgeous flowers throughout the year. Placed in the garden where caterpillars can use it as a host plant (similar concept to milkweed -- functional rather than ornamental).

### Fire Spike (Odontonema strictum)
- **Attracts:** Hummingbirds (primary attractant), butterflies
- **Native Status:** Non-native
- **Sun Requirements:** Filtered light to morning sun; NOT full afternoon sun (needs protection by 4pm); will grow in full shade but with very few blooms
- **Bloom Season:** Fall and winter (similar to Brazilian Red Cloaks)
- **Size:** Can be kept at 4 ft; will grow to 6 ft and branch out if allowed
- **Colors:** Magenta (Jennifer's favorite, rarer), red, purple
- **Design Notes:** One of Jennifer's favorite plants overall. Hummingbird attractant by far. Butterflies and hummingbirds love them. Can be propagated easily. Likes palm fertilizer (8-2-12). Plant in clusters. Place near hummingbird feeders to entice hummingbirds into the garden.

### Brazilian Red Cloak (Megaskepasma erythrochlamys)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies -- "such butterfly attractants"
- **Native Status:** Non-native (tropical)
- **Sun Requirements:** Sun to filtered light; can handle shadier spots (a Brazilian Red Cloak was placed "in the shadiest part" behind a tree for protection)
- **Bloom Season:** Fall and winter; cone-shaped gorgeous blooms
- **Size:** 6-7 ft tall
- **Design Notes:** Great companion for Pentas (matching pink tones). Stunning when mature. Blooms 8-10 months per year. Zone 10A minimum (cold-sensitive).

### Porterweed (Stachytarpheta)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies
- **Native Status:** Native varieties available
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Design Notes:** Used as a backdrop plant in a dedicated pollinator side-garden section. Combined with Lantanas, Blue My Mind, and Pentas for a full pollinator area.

### Yellow Thalia (Thalia geniculata or similar)
- **Attracts:** Birds, butterflies -- "a great, great attractant"
- **Native Status:** Native -- "a beautiful native plant to work with"
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun; loves soaking up the sun
- **Bloom Season:** 10 months of bright color per year
- **Size:** Bushes out full at top; develops 1-1.5 ft of woody trunk at the base over time
- **Design Notes:** Plant something 1-2 ft tall in front to hide the woody base. Worth using despite this drawback because the blooms pay off tremendously. Use in groups. Continued as a repeated plant in both front and side garden beds.

### Dwarf Ixora (Ixora taiwanensis / Dwarf Taiwanese)
- **Attracts:** Birds, butterflies -- "another butterfly favorite"
- **Native Status:** Non-native
- **Sun Requirements:** Full sun
- **Bloom Season:** 10-11 months of blooms
- **Size:** Dwarfed, about 3 ft; can be kept individually or allowed to connect as a solid swath
- **Design Notes:** Extremely hearty. Slow-growing, small-leafed, conforming shape (like a boxwood). Works beautifully with accent plants (False Agave, small palms) popping up from the middle. Can form a soft hedge. Used in rear areas at 3 ft with lower plants in front.

### Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea)
- **Attracts:** Butterflies, hummingbirds
- **Sun Requirements:** Sun to partial sun
- **Design Notes:** Used in a side-yard pollinator garden section alongside Pentas, Lantana, and Thalia.

## Butterfly Garden Design Tips

### Layout & Structure
- **Plant in tiered layers:** Rear wall (5-6 ft) --> mid-tier (3-4 ft) --> border/ground cover (1-2 ft). Boom-boom-boom all the way to ground level for a nice tiered effect.
- **Use drift patterns:** Same planting style as formal tropicals but with butterfly plants. Curve plantings, create loops, and maintain defined lines.
- **Create borders within the butterfly garden:** Butterfly plants want to grow together and overlap. Use non-blooming structural plants (Blaze Copperleaf, Gold Mound, Ruby Red Copperleaf) as border hedges to create divisions and lines between butterfly plantings.
- **Balance chaos with structure:** Mix "butterfly chaos" with "fine-tuning of the tropical look." Every bed should have a balance of both.
- **Mirror plantings on equal sides:** When you have spaces of equal size and distance, rinse and repeat the same design on both sides for symmetry.

### Where to Put What
- **Hide host plants in the back:** Milkweed and vines with caterpillars go behind visible plantings. Visitors see butterflies, not the mess.
- **Sunny spots are essential:** Most butterfly plants are sun varieties. Place the butterfly garden in the sunniest part of your yard.
- **Use structural trees as anchors:** Palm trees, orchid trees, and bottlebrush trees become the framework around which butterfly plants are layered.
- **Side yards and small beds work:** Even a narrow side yard section can become a dedicated pollinator nook with Lantana trees, Blue My Mind borders, Pentas, and Porterweed backdrops.

### Pesticide Warning for Butterfly Gardens
- **Keep pesticide application AWAY from your butterfly/pollinator garden.** Jennifer warns: "these products do not discriminate -- they kill everything." If you need to treat nearby plants, use the drench method (pour directly on roots) so the product goes into the root system rather than spraying broadly, which would harm pollinators.
- **Never spray insecticides on your pollinator plants.** Spot-treat only non-pollinator plants that need it.
- **Isolate pollinator zones** from the rest of the landscape where you might use systemic treatments.

### Companion Planting Combinations
- **Pentas + Brazilian Red Cloaks:** Matching pink tones make them perfect color partners.
- **Blue My Mind + Anmarie Lantana + Gold Mound:** Blue, confetti color, and chartreuse-gold for a vibrant ground-level combination.
- **Dwarf Firebush + Hibiscus + Powderpuff Tree:** Layered heights (3 ft / 5 ft / 6 ft+) with continuous red-pink-orange blooms for the rear of the garden.
- **Blue My Mind + Yellow Thalia + Lantana:** Blue, yellow, and confetti color; the yellow Thalia provides a native element with 10-month color.
- **Milkweed + Mimosa/Powderpuff Tree:** Powderpuff disguises the milkweed while both serve as butterfly attractants.
- **Dwarf Ixora + False Agave:** Conforming hedge with sculptural accent popping up; pollinators get the blooms, visitors get the visual interest.
- **Fire Spike + Lantana + Blue My Mind + Pentas:** The ultimate hummingbird-and-butterfly combo for a side-garden nook.

### Maintenance Notes
- **Pentas:** Hard prune regularly even though they're blooming; this keeps them compact and productive.
- **Lantana:** Use sterile varieties to prevent invasive spread. Trim to maintain clumping shape.
- **Dwarf Firebush:** Can be cut back to any height and will flush green from bottom to top.
- **Milkweed:** Fertilize well; healthy milkweed resists pests far better than unhealthy milkweed.
- **Blue My Mind:** Plant in well-drained areas; they like it dry.
- **Hibiscus:** Let them grow to 4-6 ft for maximum bloom production; cutting back below 3 ft results in woody stems with fewer blooms.
