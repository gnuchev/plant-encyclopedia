# Tropical Along-the-Fence Planter Recipe

*Based on the True Gardener design philosophy: "waterfall effect" layering, light/dark sandwiching, and the principle that every star needs a supporting cast.*

---

## The Layers (back to front)

Think of it as **5 tiers** cascading from the fence toward you. The designer never plants in straight rows — everything is in **staggered triangular formations**.

---

### Layer 1 — The Wall (against the fence)

Pick ONE:

| Plant | Why |
|---|---|
| **Clusia** (*Clusia guttifera*) | Dense from bottom to top, no gaps. Trim every 3 months. Keep at 6-8 ft. The designer's #1 privacy hedge — "no openings, condensed privacy." |
| **Clustering Fishtail Palm** (*Caryota mitis*) | For taller fences or full-height screening. Plant 6 ft on center in 30-gallon size. They find each other, connect, then shoot up together. Creates a living green wall. |
| **Green Buttonwood** (*Conocarpus erectus*) | Lower maintenance than Clusia (slower grower). Native, salt-tolerant. For the "set it and forget it" gardener. |

Plant **2 ft off the fence** so there's room for airflow and back-trimming.

---

### Layer 2 — The Showstopper Trees (pulled forward 3-4 ft)

Pick 1-2 specimen palms, staggered — NOT evenly spaced. These break the flat wall behind them and add vertical drama.

| Plant | Spacing | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Foxtail Palm** (*Wodyetia bifurcata*) — double or triple | One every 15-20 ft | The anchor. Self-cleaning, big silhouette. |
| **Pygmy Date Palm** (*Phoenix roebelenii*) — triple | Between foxtails or as standalone | Soft, bushy, 10-12 ft. The "palmy bushy feel." Keep natural, trim only twice a year. |
| **Christmas Palm** (*Adonidia merrillii*) | Optional, between others | Intermediate height filler. Neat, compact. |

The designer's rule: **vary the heights**. Foxtail drops to Pygmy, back up to Foxtail. That undulation is the "waterfall effect."

---

### Layer 3 — The Color Wall (mid-height, 4-8 ft)

This is your **fire layer** — warm color that draws the eye. Plant in clusters of 3-5, broken by dark-leafed plants.

| Plant | Height | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Louisiana Red Copper Leaf** (*Acalypha wilkesiana*) | 8-10 ft (trimmed to 4 ft 2x/year) | The workhorse buffer. Four 7-gallon plants = solid color wall. |
| **Brazilian Red Cloak** (*Megaskepasma erythrochlamys*) | 6-8 ft | Pink blooms nearly year-round. Three 15-gallon = dense backdrop. Gets leggy at base — that's why you need Layer 4. |
| **Blaze Copper Leaf** (*Acalypha wilkesiana 'Blaze'*) | 4-5 ft | Fire-toned. Wraps corners and fills gaps between taller plants. |

**The sandwich rule**: Dark cluster, then bright cluster, then dark cluster. Use **Rojo Congo Philodendron** or **Anthurium** groupings as the dark breaks between colorful stretches.

---

### Layer 4 — The Skirt & Accents (2-4 ft, pulled forward)

This layer **hides the leggy bases** of Layer 3 and adds texture variety. Mix accents with filler.

#### Accents (vertical eye-catchers, placed at curves or focal points)

| Plant | Notes |
|---|---|
| **False Agave** (*Furcraea foetida*) | 5 ft apart in triangular groups. "Anything vertical draws the eye." |
| **Yucca Rostrata** (*Yucca rostrata*) | Thornless, silver. Frame entrances/endpoints of the bed. |
| **Imperialis Bromeliad** (*Alcantarea imperialis*) | Dramatic rosettes around boulders. Purple in sun, green in shade. |

#### Filler (dense clusters wrapping around accents)

| Plant | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Mammy Croton** (*Codiaeum variegatum 'Mammy'*) | Rounded, colorful, stays small forever. Bring in at 7-10 gallon. |
| **Song of India** (*Dracaena reflexa*) | Yellow-green brightness in dark spots. Nip tops to keep bushy. "A plant this versatile — find good uses for it." |
| **Sanchezia** (*Sanchezia speciosa*) | The designer's go-to skirt plant. 3-5 per cluster, thickens fast. |
| **Dwarf Ixora** (*Ixora chinensis*) | Blooms 10 months/year. Sweeps of consistent color. |

---

### Layer 5 — The Ground Cover (front edge, 0-2 ft)

The finishing carpet that ties everything together and eliminates visible mulch.

| Plant | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Foxtail Fern** (*Asparagus densiflorus 'Myersii'*) | Chartreuse texture. Goes with everything. Sweeps wherever you need softness. |
| **Burle Marx Philodendron** (*Philodendron burle-marxii*) | Glossy jungle-floor look. Cascading. Shade to filtered light. |
| **Dwarf Pentas** (*Pentas lanceolata*) | Clusters of 5-6, broken by non-blooming plants. Trim mushroom-style. Butterfly magnet. |
| **Blue My Mind** (*Evolvulus glomeratus*) | Blue flower carpet at the very edge. Stair-step effect from dark to bright. |
| **Little Ruby** (*Alternanthera dentata 'Little Ruby'*) | Deep burgundy carpet. Never in straight lines. |

## Key Design Rules (from the transcripts)

1. **Never flat rows** — always triangular, staggered
2. **Dark/light/dark** — sandwich bright plants between dark-leafed ones
3. **Skirt everything** — leggy bases get hidden by the layer in front
4. **Boulders at transitions** — where two bed curves meet or where plant types change
5. **Trim palms only 2x/year** — let them stay natural and full
6. **Nip, don't hack** — Song of India, crotons, and copper leaves respond to light pruning with bushier growth
7. **One accent does the job** — a single False Agave or Yucca Rostrata is enough per vignette; don't overdo vertical accents
