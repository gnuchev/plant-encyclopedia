# Soil Health & Microbiology Guide

## A Comprehensive Reference from the John and Bob's / John Valentino YouTube Channel

**Source:** ~120 YouTube videos by John Valentino, founder of John and Bob's soil products, based in Fresno, California (USDA Zone 9). John is a professional landscaper with decades of experience who advocates a biology-first approach to gardening. His channel, often featuring "Eddie the Lazy Landscaper" and his dog Chip (the "Vice President"), covers California landscaping with a relentless focus on building soil life rather than relying on synthetic inputs. All quotes below are attributed to John Valentino or his guests unless otherwise noted.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Feed the Soil, Not the Plant

The single most important principle across the entire channel is that healthy plants begin with healthy soil -- and healthy soil is defined by the life within it.

> "At John and Bob's, we believe in a simple truth. Feed the soil and the plants will follow." -- John Valentino

> "Our John and Bob's line of products is focused more on feeding the soil and then the soil feeds the plant, rather than artificially providing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium in a way that can be harsh." -- John Valentino

> "I think it's the most important part of landscaping and gardening, and that's the health of your soil. And I define healthy soil by soil that has lots of beneficial microbiology. So beneficial bacteria, fungi, good nematodes, protozoa. If you build life in the soil, you're creating soil that can most effectively feed your plants and most effectively prevent and defeat pests and disease." -- John Valentino

### The Gut Health Analogy

John frequently compares soil biology to human gut health:

> "We're trying to put yogurt in your soil. We're trying to build the microbiology in your soil like you're trying to build it in your own gut. And that's the key to good health for people and good health for plants." -- John Valentino

### Soil That Produces Its Own Nutrients

The ultimate goal is soil so biologically active that it generates its own fertility:

> "The real secret is to build soil underneath your lawn that can create its own nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other minerals and nutrients. When you have good fungi and good microbiology, it's much more powerful than the bad fungus that causes these big brown areas and the underperformance of lawn." -- John Valentino

> "Why not use something that allows your soil to create its own NPK? That can be done if you're using something to feed the soil every time you try to feed your lawn." -- John Valentino

> "The more work you do on your soil in terms of building it full of life, the less you will need to use inputs like organic fertilizer, any kind of fertilizer, because the soil will be producing its own nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium." -- John Valentino

### Soil Aerates Itself

When soil biology is thriving, mechanical interventions become unnecessary:

> "Healthy soil aerates itself through microbiology and all of the result of microbiology such as earthworms. And all of that activity in the soil eats the thatch." -- John Valentino

---

## 2. The Soil Food Web Explained

The soil food web is a hierarchy of organisms where each tier feeds on the one below, and each tier's waste products release nutrients in forms that plants can absorb.

### The Tiers of Soil Life

| Tier | Organisms | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| **1st (Base)** | Bacteria | Decompose organic matter; the simplest and most ubiquitous form of soil life |
| **2nd** | Fungi (including mycorrhizae) | Decompose organic matter; extend root reach; form symbiotic relationships with plants |
| **3rd** | Protozoa | Consume bacteria and fungi; release nutrients in plant-available form |
| **4th** | Beneficial Nematodes | Consume bacteria, fungi, and other organisms; release nutrients |
| **5th** | Micro-arthropods | "Like mini spiders, little eight-legged creepy crawlies" that eat lower tiers; completely microscopic |
| **Macro level** | Earthworms | The visible result of a thriving food web; aerate soil, process organic matter |

### How Nutrients Are Released

> "The way it works is bacteria and fungi eat organic matter. When they eat, they break nutrients into tiny usable pieces. Then protozoa and nematodes eat the bacteria and the fungi. And when they poop, they release nutrients in exactly the form that plants can absorb." -- John Valentino

### The Importance of Complexity

Soil with only bacteria is considered underdeveloped. The goal is to build complex, multi-tier life:

> "Soil that's bacterial dominated and not so healthy and not so advanced in terms of microbiology has more weeds. And so we want to develop the life in the soil beyond just bacteria. We want fungi and protozoa and good nematodes, and those more highly developed soils have less weeds." -- John Valentino

> "Bacteria is the lowest form of life... bacterial-based soil isn't what we want. We want soil with bacteria, fungi, protozoa, good nematodes." -- John Valentino

### Engaging the Soil Food Web

> "We're going to engage the soil food web. And getting that soil food web to work for us is the way to have a healthy landscape." -- John Valentino

> "No matter what kind of soil you have -- if let's say you have heavy clay soil with hard pan -- what's the best way to change it? Really the only way to change it is to engage the soil food web, fill it full of microbiological life: good bacteria, good fungi, good protozoa, good nematodes, and that will change everything about it." -- John Valentino

### The Food Web Progression

> "You start with infusing it with bacteria, then fungi eat the bacteria, and then protozoa and good nematodes, and you build up this whole community of beneficial microbes that go higher and higher up, resulting in earthworms." -- John Valentino

---

## 3. Humic and Fulvic Acids

Humic and fulvic acids are considered foundational soil amendments -- the "end product of decomposition of organic matter."

### What They Do

> "Humic and fulvic acid are magical. They're the end product of decomposition of organic matter. They chelate all kinds of minerals that plants can use and they assist your soil in absorbing and using nutrients more effectively." -- John Valentino

In simpler terms: "It collects the nutrients from the soil in one of the most efficient ways and delivers it throughout the plant."

### Quality Standards

John specifies exact quality thresholds:

> "There are a lot of products available that have good quality humic and fulvic acid. The one thing that's important to know is the quality. We want at least 40 to 50% humic, at least 12 to 15% fulvic, and then a bunch of other organic compounds, bringing total organic compounds to over 80%." -- John Valentino

| Component | Minimum Target |
|-----------|---------------|
| Humic acid | 40-50% |
| Fulvic acid | 12-15% |
| Total organic compounds | Over 80% |

### Application

> "You can apply them topically like in the root zones, but even outside the root zones. That way, we're improving soil and addressing plant growth. Water activates it. So, at some point, you have to water them in." -- John Valentino

### Humic Acid in the John and Bob's Line

- **Optimize** (Soil Optimizer): "Our attempt to use humic and fulvic acid together with some other key nutrients to make them as effective as they can be in your soil."
- **Penetrate Liquid BioTiller**: Contains liquid humic acid among its ingredients.
- Humic acid also feeds fungi specifically: "Humic acid is in one of your products that feeds fungi."
- Humic acid can cancel out chlorine/chloramine in water: "The water that we like to use has been treated with humic acid to cancel out the chlorine or chloramine."

---

## 4. Mycorrhizae

Mycorrhizae are symbiotic fungi that colonize plant roots and dramatically extend their ability to uptake water and nutrients.

### What Mycorrhizae Do

> "Mycorrhizae is a really incredible beneficial microbe that does live on roots and one of the most powerful beneficial fungi we know of at this time." -- John Valentino

### Application Rules

**The critical rule: Mycorrhizae must touch the roots to be effective.**

> "You have to make sure you apply it close to root systems, otherwise it's lost." -- John Valentino

When planting, blend should be mixed directly into the backfill so that mycorrhizae and other biologicals are in direct contact with roots:

> "We've got mycorrhizae and all our other things actually touching the roots of the new tomatoes." -- John Valentino

### When to Apply

> "Definitely every time you plant something new I would use mycorrhizae. I like the idea of doing it every spring if you can." -- John Valentino

### Where Mycorrhizae Is Found in the Product Line

- **Maximize**: "Maximize has a good quality compost. It has mycorrhizae. It has ground-up basalt."
- Maximize contains "beneficial bacteria and fungi including the most famous fungi, mycorrhizae, and it has a lot of minerals in the form of ground up basalt from old lava deposits."

---

## 5. John and Bob's Product Application Guide

### Product Overview

The John and Bob's system is built on the idea of isolating the most important components of high-quality compost into concentrated, easy-to-apply products:

> "We isolated those ingredients in good quality compost and we have three products that we did that with and they are called Optimize, Maximize, and Nourish Biosol." -- John Valentino

### Individual Product Descriptions

#### Optimize (Soil Optimizer)

- **What it is:** Concentrated organic matter with calcium and iron
- **What it does:** Attracts and feeds beneficial soil microbes over the long term; contains humic and fulvic acid
- **Key trait:** Breaks down very slowly; a patient, long-term approach to soil building
- **Coverage:** 3 lb bag treats 1,000 sq ft

> "Optimize is concentrated organic matter, calcium and iron. It attracts and feeds zillions of beneficial soil microbes." -- John Valentino

> "Optimize is inexpensive because you need very little to treat large areas. In fact, our three-lb bag will treat 1,000 square ft." -- John Valentino

#### Maximize

- **What it is:** Contains live soil organisms (bacteria, fungi including mycorrhizae, protozoa) plus ground basalt minerals
- **What it does:** Introduces higher-level microbes and every mineral in the periodic table
- **Key trait:** The only product that actually has living soil organisms in it; "functions like a high quality compost, does a lot of the same things that earthworm castings do"

> "Maximize contains every mineral in the periodic table and it has higher level microbes: bacteria, fungi, protozoa." -- John Valentino

> "The maximize -- that's the one that actually has soil life in it. It has beneficial bacteria and fungi including the most famous fungi, mycorrhizae, and it has a lot of minerals in the form of ground up basalt from old lava deposits." -- John Valentino

#### Nourish Biosol

- **What it is:** An all-natural organic fertilizer and soil builder made from dried mycelium -- the bloom of cultured soybean meal and cotton seed meal
- **What it does:** Feeds both the lawn/plants AND the soil simultaneously; provides NPK plus minor nutrients
- **Key trait:** The only product with significant macronutrients; can be applied anytime; water activates it

> "Nourish Biosol is our organic fertilizer and soil builder made from the bloom of cultured soybean meal and cotton seed meal." -- John Valentino

> "Dried mycelium is the best organic fertilizer I've ever used. I say that because dried mycelium has this rare ability to not only feed plants with NPK and even with minor nutrients, but it feeds the soil at the same time." -- John Valentino

> "It allows people to be a little more patient because dried mycelium is going to make everything look great faster, whereas our other formulas are more of a slow-acting formula that works over time." -- John Valentino

#### Penetrate Liquid BioTiller

- **What it is:** A two-part liquid product -- one bottle with beneficial bacteria, one with food for bacteria (saponin, liquid humic acid, kelp)
- **What it does:** Breaks up hard clay and compacted soil; kickstarts biological life; can be sprayed on foliage for pest/disease control
- **Key trait:** Bottles kept separate so bacteria don't consume food before application; water is just a carrier
- **Ingredients:** Beneficial bacteria, liquid humic acid, saponin, kelp

> "Penetrate is an organic liquid BioTiller that breaks up very hard clay and compacted soil. It contains bacteria and food for bacteria -- actually food for all kinds of microbes -- which kickstarts the process of building complex life, and it's complex life that is the key to healthy soil." -- John Valentino

> "The name infers it's only for heavy soil, but it's great for sandy soil also." -- John Valentino

> "This is a very gentle way of kind of encouraging plants to do their best. It has things like kelp, beneficial bacteria, humic acid, saponin." -- John Valentino

#### Blend (The Combination Product)

- **What it is:** A proportional mix of the three dry products
- **Formula:** 1 part Optimize : 2 parts Nourish Biosol : 3 parts Maximize

> "We take the three dry products -- Soil Optimizer, Nourish Biosol, and Maximize -- and we have a mixture that we use on all our jobs. We use one part Soil Optimizer, two parts Nourish Biosol, three parts Maximize. So one, two, three -- it's easy to keep track of. We mix it together and we call it Blend." -- John Valentino

> "Blend is 100% organic, safe for people and pets." -- John Valentino

**Storage note:** "We recommend you use Blend within 60 days because sometimes it goes to work in the bag if you try to store it for longer, especially if there's heat involved. If you're concerned about this you can buy the products separately and that allows you to store them indefinitely."

### Application Rates

| Product | Rate | Coverage |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Blend** (lawns, broad areas) | 17-20 lbs per 1,000 sq ft (standard); up to 25-30 lbs per 1,000 sq ft for problem areas | 6 lb bag treats ~350 sq ft |
| **Blend** (small plants/starters) | 1 cup per plant | -- |
| **Blend** (small trees/shrubs) | 1.5 cups per plant | -- |
| **Blend** (large trees/shrubs) | 3 cups per plant | -- |
| **Blend** (roses) | 3 cups per rose bush | -- |
| **Blend** (containers/planters) | Double the in-ground application rate | -- |
| **Blend** (1-gallon container) | 1-2 cups | -- |
| **Blend** (5-gallon container) | ~3 cups | -- |
| **Blend** (15-gallon container) | ~5 cups | -- |
| **Nourish Biosol** (lawns) | 6-10 lbs per 1,000 sq ft | -- |
| **Optimize** (broad areas) | 3 lb bag per 1,000 sq ft | -- |
| **Penetrate Liquid BioTiller** | 8 oz per 1,000 sq ft; 32 oz per 4,000 sq ft | Mix both bottles with 1+ gallons of water as carrier |

### Application Method

- **Blend:** Applied by hand topically; no need to till in. Water activates it. "You don't need to be precise. You can't burn it and you can't over apply. So if you want to use twice that much, that's fine."
- **Penetrate:** Use a hose-end sprayer, backpack sprayer, or bucket. Combine both bottles with water. "A helpful tip on a backpack sprayer -- take off the nozzle, which allows it to flow out more and makes the application a lot faster."
- **Pro tip:** "Apply Blend or any of our dry products and then spray Penetrate Liquid BioTiller right over the top of them to begin to activate it, rather than waiting for rain."
- **Rest period:** "If possible, allow it to rest for a few days after you apply it. This allows for the establishment of the beneficial bacteria without being disturbed."

### The Power Combination for Pest/Disease Control

For aphids, whitefly, and persistent pest or disease problems:

> "Use the Blend around the root ball and then on top of the Blend use about 2 inches of earthworm castings. Tremendously effective for white fly and aphid." -- John Valentino

> "That combination of Blend, Penetrate Liquid BioTiller, and earthworm castings is the best thing I've come across for minimizing pest and disease and maximizing vitality." -- John Valentino

## 6. Microscope Soil Testing (Dr. Elaine Ingham Method)

John featured soil microbiologist Shannon (a landscape architect from Napa, California who studied under Dr. Elaine Ingham) for a hands-on microscope soil analysis video.

### Who Is Dr. Elaine Ingham?

> "I took Dr. Elaine Ingham's class online. She's a world-renowned soil microbiologist." -- Shannon

The John and Bob's product formulas themselves were developed with her guidance:

> "We kind of based the formulas of all these products on the work of a soil scientist named Dr. Elaine Ingham, and she was telling me that she felt there might be better ways to get to where we were trying to go rather than molasses, which she thought would make a too bacteria-dominated product. You don't want to favor one of the microbes over the other, particularly the lowest form, which is bacteria." -- John Valentino

### Soil Sampling Protocol

**Step 1: Collect samples**
- Take soil samples from **3 different locations** within the area you are testing
- Sample at approximately **3 inches deep** (1 to 3 inches down)
- Use a 1-inch diameter core sample if possible (a soil coring device is helpful but not required)
- **Avoid mulch or surface material** -- "You want to avoid any kind of mulch or anything that's on top because you can't really break that down and really see what's going on in the soil."

**Step 2: Prepare the sample**
- Break up the soil and the aggregates into smaller pieces
- Measure out **1 dry milliliter of soil**
- Add **4 milliliters of water** (treated with humic acid to neutralize chlorine/chloramine)
- "The water that we like to use when we do this has been treated with humic acid to cancel out the chlorine or chloramine that's in there because it's really not good for the biology. We don't want to kill the little guys before we can see them under the microscope."

**Step 3: Agitate**
- Gently shake for about 30 seconds using Dr. Ingham's method: "Just back and forth, about one second per shaky shake"
- The goal is to loosen biological components hiding in cracks and crevices of soil particles without killing organisms

**Step 4: Examine under the microscope**
- Place sample on a slide
- Start at lower magnification; 400x magnification allows you to see mouth parts of nematodes

### What to Look For

| Organism | What It Looks Like | Significance |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Bacteria** | "Not much... kind of don't move, bunch of dots" | Omnipresent; the base level of life; present in virtually all soil |
| **Fungal hyphae** | Long, filamentous strands | "The way that you can tell if it's beneficial or not is you want them to be dark brown in color and then the thicker the better." 1.5+ microns across is good. |
| **Nematodes** | "They squirm around like crazy"; much larger than bacteria at 400x | Beneficial nematodes eat bacteria (check mouth parts); bad nematodes eat roots |
| **Micro-arthropods** | "Like mini spiders, little eight-legged creepy crawlies" with hairy legs | Higher up in the food web; a strong indicator of complex, healthy soil |

### Interpreting Results

- **Bacteria only:** The soil is underdeveloped. "Many soils don't have good nematodes because they're underdeveloped. They don't have complex life. They have the simplest form of life: bacteria."
- **Fungi present:** A good indicator of advancing soil health. "We want more than just bacteria... the fungi is going to eat the bacteria and then other higher life forms are going to eat the fungi."
- **Nematodes present:** Excellent sign. "When the kind of high-level organisms eat the bacteria and fungi, that's when the nutrients are released in a plant-available form."
- **Micro-arthropods present:** Outstanding. These are higher up in the food web and indicate a well-developed soil ecosystem.

## 7. Earthworm Castings

Earthworm castings are essentially high-quality compost and one of John's most recommended soil amendments alongside his own products.

### What They Are

> "One source of good quality compost that I really like is earthworm castings. That's essentially a high quality compost." -- John Valentino

### Uses

- **General soil building:** Thin layers applied topically as mulch or soil amendment
- **Pest control (aphids, whitefly):** Applied as a 1.5-2 inch thick layer over Blend around root zones
- **Indoor plants:** Small amounts mixed into potting soil
- **Mulch replacement:** "The owner did a neat thing -- he used earthworm castings as his mulch."
- **Summer feeding:** Safe to apply in summer heat when synthetic fertilizers would burn

> "Compost, compost tea, even thin layers of earthworm castings. We make a whole line of products that work really well in the summer and can't burn." -- John Valentino

### The Earthworm Castings + Blend Protocol for Pest Control

> "If you have a tree that tends to get aphid or white fly, use the Blend and then over the Blend as a mulch we use about inch and a half to 2 inches of earthworm castings, and then you can spray right over that with Penetrate Liquid BioTiller. Does a fantastic job." -- John Valentino

### Earthworms as Indicators

Seeing earthworms in your soil is a sign that the full soil food web is functioning:

> "Oh look at that -- we got the soil food web working with an earthworm! That's what we want in sandy soil. That's rich sandy soil." -- John Valentino

---

## 8. Basalt Rock Dust for Minerals

Ground basalt (from old lava deposits) provides a comprehensive mineral profile that feeds soil microbes and produces more nutrient-dense plants.

### Why Minerals Matter

> "There's lots of consternation recently about the depletion of our soil, which makes it so farmers are producing food depleted in minerals and nutritional value. And that's exactly what things like basalt are about -- so that you can have soil that produces plants full of minerals, full of nutritional values." -- John Valentino

### What Basalt Does

> "I'm a big fan of ground basalt because it's full of minerals, and minerals are a great food for beneficial microbes of all kinds." -- John Valentino

> "Minerals really are the key to unlocking a lot of microbiology in the soil." -- John Valentino

### Application Frequency

> "We recommend it once every 6 months. There's some gardens that are tremendously established and doing really well -- you could probably get by once a year." -- John Valentino

### Where to Find It

- Available as a standalone product (ground basalt)
- Already included in **Maximize**: "We do have ground basalt in our Maximize."
- Also beneficial: biochar, fish fertilizer, kelp

> "Products like compost, earthworm castings, biochar, ground basalt, humic acid, fish fertilizer are good for soil." -- John Valentino

---

## 9. Compost Tea

Compost tea is mentioned throughout the channel as one of the core methods for building soil life, though John positions his products as a more convenient concentrated alternative.

### Role in Soil Building

> "The way to make your soil rich in microbiology is to either use compost, compost tea, or our concentrated products where we take parts of compost and compost tea and we use them in very simple products that you can apply topically." -- John Valentino

### When to Use Compost Tea

- As an alternative or complement to concentrated products
- For building soil life in any situation (lawns, gardens, trees)
- Safe to use in summer when synthetic fertilizers would burn
- Applicable to both indoor and outdoor plants

> "In order to improve life in your soil, outdoor products like a good compost, a good compost tea, our Maximize, Optimize, Nourish Biosol, our Penetrate Liquid BioTiller -- those are all products that are part of a system that build soil life." -- John Valentino

### Relationship to John and Bob's Products

John views compost tea as sharing the same goal as his product line -- building complex soil life:

> "The easiest way to make your soil healthy, full of life, is either with our products or compost, compost tea, things like earthworm castings. They all feed the soil." -- John Valentino

> "For soil, we need products that encourage life. The soil can be improved dramatically with products that increase complex life in the soil. So beneficial bacteria, fungi, protozoa, good nematodes. That's really the essence of our product line. So we would encourage you to use Optimize and Nourish Biosol and Maximize and our Penetrate Liquid BioTiller -- particularly good for heavy soil that doesn't drain well. Instead of our products, you could use really good quality compost or compost tea." -- John Valentino

---

## 10. Seasonal Application Calendar

### Spring (Primary Application Season)

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Apply Blend | 17-20 lbs per 1,000 sq ft over lawns; 3 cups per large shrub/tree |
| Spray Penetrate Liquid BioTiller | 8 oz per 1,000 sq ft over everything, right over the Blend |
| Apply Nourish Biosol | 6-10 lbs per 1,000 sq ft on lawns for green-up |
| Apply mycorrhizae | Every spring when possible; always when planting new |
| Target feeding | Extra Blend on underperforming plants |

> "Since it's spring, we're pretty much going to feed the soil and the plants on everything, but we're going to give particular attention to the things that are underperforming." -- John Valentino

### Summer

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly Penetrate sprays | Especially on underperforming plants and vegetable gardens |
| Avoid synthetic fertilizers | "You need to be very careful with them because they can really burn lawns and plants easily in the summer" |
| Safe organic feeding | "Compost, compost tea, even thin layers of earthworm castings... can't burn" |
| Water deeply, less frequently | Encourage deep rooting |

### Fall (Secondary Application Season)

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Second Blend application | Especially if garden has problems or heavy-feeding plants |
| Second Penetrate application | "We recommend two yearly applications: spring and fall" |
| Pre-winter soil building | "I like to do very early fall applications so we get these products to work and actually have a major benefit before they go into dormancy" |
| Overseed lawns (warm climates) | Apply Blend and Penetrate right over seed |
| Prepare for frost protection | Blend + Penetrate gives "2 to 3 degree edge" as antifreeze effect |

### Winter

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Optimize application | "That's the one product that you can apply before spring and allow rain and moisture to start to break it down. It breaks down very slowly." |
| Minimal intervention | Mostly monitoring; avoid applying in coldest periods |
| Mulch for insulation | Helps keep soil temperature moderate for biology |

### Frequency Summary

| Product | Recommended Frequency |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Blend** | Once or twice per year (spring minimum; fall for problem areas or heavy feeders) |
| **Penetrate Liquid BioTiller** | Twice per year (spring and fall); monthly for establishing new landscapes or problem areas |
| **Nourish Biosol** | Once or twice per year as needed for lawn greening |
| **Optimize** | Can be applied on its own as a budget option; once or twice per year |
| **Basalt/Minerals** | Once every 6 months; once a year for established gardens |

> "By continuing to apply those products every 6 months or so, we're changing the soil on an ongoing basis rather than just when we did the renovation." -- John Valentino

> "In an established garden that doesn't have any problems, Blend about once a year is plenty. If you have an established garden that has problems with fungal disease in the lawn or lots of pests, then you'd do it more." -- John Valentino

### Containers and Raised Beds

> "In raised planters and pots, you'll never have to change your soil again if you annually treat it with Blend and Penetrate Liquid BioTiller." -- John Valentino

> "For planters and containers, double the application rate when using Blend." -- John Valentino

> "You can even grow tomatoes year after year in the same soil if you use Penetrate and Blend together on an annual basis." -- John Valentino

---

## 11. Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Relying on Synthetic Fertilizers

Synthetic fertilizers feed the plant directly while ignoring -- and often damaging -- the soil.

> "Unfortunately, over the decades, subtle problems with its chemical formulations have multiplied into real negatives, and those are characteristic of almost all synthetic fertilizers. They can disrupt the soil pH, make the soil more acid, and it can lead to a buildup of salts and chemicals that plants can't use, and more importantly, that your soil doesn't like." -- John Valentino (on Miracle-Gro)

> "A lot of products that you buy in regular garden centers only feed the lawn. They don't feed the soil. We believe in feeding the soil because it will prevent the lawn from having this kind of problem in the future." -- John Valentino

**Thatch buildup from synthetic fertilizer:**

> "Thatch builds up when you use mostly chemical fertilizer and you don't have a lot of life in your soil. So you're kind of feeding the soil directly with nutrients that it likes like nitrogen and phosphorus and potassium and you end up with thatch." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 2: Using Chemicals to Treat Pests and Disease

Chemical treatments kill the very soil life that would naturally prevent problems.

> "When people treat for root knot nematodes with chemicals, you start this process of damaging life in your soil and it can become severely damaged. In fact, after using typical products to kill root knot nematodes, the soil is pretty much lifeless and not a good place to garden." -- John Valentino

> "If you don't have a soil food web and you're just attacking one negative organism with a bunch of pesticides, it's not going to work out in the long term. It might kill that one organism, but if everything else is dead..." -- Shannon

### Mistake 3: Chemical Fungicides That Damage Soil Enzymes

> "When you spray chemicals like BioAdvanced fungus control, you are negatively impacting that ecosystem of tremendous life. So, proponazole is the only active ingredient and it has a lot of negative realities to soil life. It inhibits soil enzyme activity, specifically a decrease in soil dehydrogenase." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Chlorinated Water's Effect on Biology

> "Even our water that's chlorinated damages life. We need to think of ways that we can improve life in the soil." -- John Valentino

**Tip for microscope work:** Treat water with humic acid to neutralize chlorine/chloramine before using it to examine soil samples.

### Mistake 5: Using Molasses as the Primary Soil Amendment

While not toxic, molasses can lead to bacteria-dominated soil rather than balanced complex life:

> "Molasses does feed the soil, but it's mostly bacteria building... Dr. Elaine Ingham was telling me that she felt there might be better ways to get to where we were trying to go rather than molasses, which she thought would make a too bacteria-dominated product. You don't want to favor one of the microbes over the other, particularly the lowest form, which is bacteria." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 6: Putting Amendments at the Bottom of Planting Holes

> "I'm not a big fan of putting it in the bottom of the hole because most microbiology and soil is in the top inch or two and that's what we're promoting here is microbiology. But if we put it at the bottom then water comes and just leeches it through." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 7: Expecting Immediate Results When Transitioning

Switching from synthetic fertilizer to biological soil building takes patience:

> "When you stop feeding with Miracle-Gro or a product like that really high in nitrogen, your lawn or your plants will react in a way that doesn't look healthy even though we're in the process of building really healthy soil." -- John Valentino

> "It might be a year or two before you notice a difference in the vitality and color of your lawn after beginning to use compost or compost tea." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 8: Overcomplicating It with Specialized Products

> "We don't really believe that's necessary. We believe what's necessary is healthy soil." -- John Valentino (on companies selling specialized fertilizers for every plant type)

### Mistake 9: Not Mulching

> "It's important with any kind of soil to mulch. The other thing that's real important as you use our products or a good compost product or earthworm castings -- anything with life -- is to mulch the soil." -- John Valentino

Mulch helps in winter (insulates soil, protects biology) and summer (keeps soil cooler, reduces evaporation).

## Quick Reference: The Complete Soil Building System

```
STEP 1: APPLY BLEND (dry, topical)
   1 part Optimize + 2 parts Nourish Biosol + 3 parts Maximize
   Rate: 17-20 lbs / 1,000 sq ft (lawns) or 1-3 cups per plant

STEP 2: SPRAY PENETRATE LIQUID BIOTILLER (liquid, over the top)
   Mix both bottles (bacteria + food) with water
   Rate: 8 oz / 1,000 sq ft
   Spray right over the Blend to activate it

STEP 3: OPTIONAL BOOST
   - Nourish Biosol at 6-10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft for lawn greening
   - 2 inches of earthworm castings for pest/disease control
   - Ground basalt every 6-12 months for minerals

STEP 4: WATER IN
   Water activates all products; can also wait for rain

STEP 5: MULCH
   2-inch layer to protect biology and retain moisture

REPEAT: Spring and Fall minimum; monthly Penetrate for problem areas

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Feed the soil, not the plant.** The soil, when biologically active, will feed the plant naturally.
2. **Build complex life, not just bacteria.** The hierarchy -- bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, micro-arthropods, earthworms -- is the key.
3. **Patience pays off.** Transitioning from synthetic to biological takes 6-24 months but creates self-sustaining fertility.
4. **You can't over-apply biological products.** Unlike synthetics, these products won't burn. The suggested rates are for best value, not safety limits.
5. **Mycorrhizae must touch roots.** Always apply at planting time, directly in the backfill.
6. **Soil biology provides natural pest and disease resistance.** Complex soil life outcompetes and consumes harmful organisms.
7. **Healthy soil acts as antifreeze.** Complex microbiology gives plants 2-3 extra degrees of frost tolerance.
8. **Every application of anything should benefit the soil.** "Every time you put something on your lawn, try to make it something that's good for your soil that builds life."
