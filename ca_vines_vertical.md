## Why Vines Matter in the Landscape

Valentino frames vines as a multi-purpose, budget-friendly design tool:

> "Strategically placed vines are a great addition to the garden, which can add color in the form of bloom, interest in the pattern it makes on a wall, and privacy. The vine can either screen noise or screen views that are undesirable. And in that way, vines can be another part of creating these separate spaces inexpensively."

## Star Jasmine / Confederate Jasmine

Star jasmine (*Trachelospermum jasminoides*) appears across many Valentino projects as one of the workhorse plants for Central California. It is referenced in both vine and ground-cover roles.

**Versatility -- vine, ground cover, or espalier:**

> "So, this plant can hide unsightly objects on your wall like irrigation controllers or backflow preventers. And it can be used as a living green fence as long as you support it."

> "They don't need that heavy a pruning. You know, you're able to keep them to a decent size without intruding. It could be more natural looking if you want it to be. And so it's not one of those critical things that has to be pruned all the time."

> "It's an evergreen plant. Always looks pretty good. It's very versatile. It's used in a lot of different ways. You can even use it as a ground cover. Instead of growing it up, you could just plant it on the ground and it grows all over the ground to about 2 to 3 ft tall."

Star jasmine is listed alongside cape honeysuckle as an indicator of healthy soil in bloom:

> "The number one thing you need to grow a beautiful garden is healthy soil. That's what allows your star jasmine and cape honeysuckle and your fotinia and your hibiscus to thrive and bloom properly and not have pest and disease."

**Espalier form:** A commercial installation is noted as "15g espol star jasmine" -- a 15-gallon specimen trained flat against a structure, demonstrating that star jasmine can be grown as a formal espalier.

**As ground cover:** Asian jasmine (a close relative) and star jasmine are both used as ground-plane plants in Valentino's small-garden designs, paired with dymondia for texture contrast.

## Trumpet Vine (Campsis radicans)

Trumpet vine is presented as an aggressive, fast-growing climber that can cover structures in a single season.

> "This is trumpet vine that Eddie's used to grow up on the outside of his chimney. He's getting voracious growth out of it. It's amazing all of us by how fast it grows."

> "This is only a year old and I got it when it was this big."

**Annual pruning cycle:** Despite the speed, Valentino notes it is manageable:

> "At some point, I may have to prune it and it'll start getting runners down here and I may prune those back, but really not much not much effort at all in that. It doesn't grow so fast that you have to prune it more than once a year. You need to be careful how you prune it because you're growing this for the flowers."

**Bloom limitation:**

> "The only complaint I have about this, if it's even a legitimate one, is it doesn't have a long blooming cycle because it's so pretty, but it certainly greens up and stays green year round."

**Best use:** Covering chimneys, utility structures, or any vertical surface you want to disappear quickly. Expect once-a-year pruning of runners. Prune carefully to preserve flower buds.

## Creeping Fig (Ficus pumila)

Creeping fig is mentioned as one of the vine options for fence and wall screening:

> "Jasmine, Ivy, creeping fig -- all of those things, if you have a fence, make good green screens in addition to the fence, but usually you need some kind of support."

Valentino also notes "a little bit of creeping fig" among the plant palette for the Fresno Chaffee Zoo Kingdoms of Asia exhibit, where it grows on artificial concrete walls alongside star jasmine and bougainvillea. Creeping fig is self-clinging and works well on masonry surfaces where other vines would need a trellis.

## Climbing Roses (Cross-Reference)

Climbing roses are covered in detail in the dedicated climbing-roses video and summarized here for their vertical-gardening aspects. For full rose care, pruning schedules, and variety selection, see the **Rose Guide**.

**Key vertical-gardening points:**

> "If your goal is to plant climbing roses then you need to be aware they won't grab on to a fence."

Valentino solved this with a welded-wire trellis system (see section below). Six varieties were selected for Fresno's hot summers: **Don Juan, Joseph's Coat, Pretty and Pink, Golden Opportunity, Zephirine Drouhin, and Lavender Crush**.

> "There's quite a variation in climbing row sizes, so when you select the rows some don't get that big, some don't spread that much, some of these spread more."

**Pruning climbing roses on wire:**

> "For climbing roses you don't do a lot of pruning because it's almost impossible to prune them once they get intertwined in the wire, but you can prune for width and so you might want to come and prune it to keep encouraging it to stay flat."

**Timeline to coverage:**

> "I'd say about 3 years the wall will mostly be covered. In about 3 years you'll see much more climbing roses than wire."

---

## Welded Wire Trellis Systems

This is Valentino's go-to support method for climbing roses, vines on fences, and zoo-exhibit green walls. The technique appears in multiple videos.

### Materials and Construction

> "These are 16 ft long, 5 ft tall, heavy gauge welded wire in 4x4 squares. We found that stores like Home Depot and Lowe's have something similar but they're not as heavy a gauge a wire, and we like this heavy gauge cuz it gives a little bit of support to the fence and it's strong -- and these roses over time get heavy."

> "Yeah, you can use thinner wire. I'm not really impressed with the finished effect. It tends to not be as rigid and it might waffle."

> "If you use any other products it's more expensive. If you build a wood trellis it's way more expensive. So this is simple, easy to construct."

### Painting to Blend

The signature technique -- paint everything "Dragon's Breath" (Benjamin Moore) so the hardware disappears:

> "We painted it a nondescript color that makes it not real noticeable and we used the Benjamin Moore color Dragon's Breath. You should hardly notice the wire and eventually the Roses will touch each other and you won't see the wire at all."

> "We drilled holes in the block wall and we used this simple what I call EY hooks... and we painted them Dragon's Breath also and we used enough to support these 16 ft long pieces. We put them in about every 8 ft."

This same system was deployed at the Fresno Chaffee Zoo:

> "We used a lot of welded wire, very heavy duty welded wire, which we painted Dragon's Breath to blend in with the colors of this artificial concrete walls built all over the zoo."

### Attaching Vines to Wire

> "You want to plant them as close to the wire as you can get. I would prefer that these closer but the reason they're not, and many times they're not on a block wall, is there's a footing and the footing is solid concrete and so you can't get any closer unless you want to damage the footing."

> "You don't have to go out there every day and help them twist around it, but you have to get them started so they'll latch onto that wire and then they on their own they'll start to grab it and grow. And I like to use green horticultural tape -- we'll just tie the rose tendrils to the wire."

### Welded Wire as Fence Extension for Privacy

> "We know we want a better screen for the Neighbors here and one simple way to do that is with a welded wire fence and then grow vines on it."

> "We just did this new screen -- we're going to grow a vine on it to extend a very short neighbor fence so that we can increase privacy for them and for us."

## Living Walls vs. Green Walls -- The Valentino Distinction

Valentino draws an important cost-and-maintenance distinction between engineered "living walls" (modular panel systems) and what he calls "green walls" (plants in the ground trained up structures).

> "There's been a lot of publicity recently about these beautiful living walls which are kind of a engineering feat. It creates a fantastic effect. Unfortunately it's a lot of work and a lot of expense and not easy to keep up over time and have it look its best over time."

> "The zoo was considering having us do a living wall in all these spots but because of those concerns we thought it'd be a lot less expensive and a lot more in keeping with their maintenance desires to actually just plant the plants in the ground and have them grow up walls and Cascade over walls and create what we call a green wall instead of a living wall."

**The preferred method:** Plant in the ground at the base of the wall, install welded wire painted to blend, and let the vine grow up and cascade over. This approach was used extensively at the Fresno Chaffee Zoo's Kingdoms of Asia exhibit with star jasmine, bougainvillea, and creeping fig.

---

## Cascading Over Walls

Valentino uses the cascade technique as the complement to growing up:

> "This is an example of what we're doing in a lot of spots here and that is using Vines to Cascade over walls and Vines to grow up walls."

Plants used for cascading at the zoo include star jasmine, bougainvillea, and creeping fig. At residential sites, trailing lantana (purple and white mixed) is used to cascade over courtyard walls:

> "This area in front of this Courtyard wall was set up with lantana. We mixed a purple and white trailing Lantana and it has covered in pretty good."

---

## Arbor and Pergola Plantings

Arbors are central to Valentino's design vocabulary -- they extend the house into the garden as "outdoor rooms."

### Design Placement

> "If you decide to build an arbor somewhere -- you like the idea of extending the garden out from the house almost like an outdoor room -- then consider the best opportunities for to do that, where you have spaces in the house that are best expanded upon, like these double French doors."

> "This is a North exposure. We planned this Arbor which is going to have vines on it and you can see this wire is going to have fans and lights."

### Wisteria on Arbors

Wisteria is the signature arbor vine, but Valentino repeatedly warns about structural requirements:

> "Wisteria is a real strong growing vine so if you're going to grow wisteria on some kind of overhead structure it needs to be a really sturdy structure."

> "What is very notorious of Wisteria is the tremendous size and weight of the supporting branches, so it's a mistake to put one in your garden without really heavy support, really good strong support, like we did a garden we showed you with a metal Arbor."

**Training wisteria up posts:**

> "You want to make sure you leave some big lines, bring them up the post, bring them straight up. We'll tie them up... that tape it's meant for this kind of stuff, you know, stretches with the plant as the plant grows."

> "You got to prune the bottom of it so that way the plant concentrates the growth energy to the top and not on the bottom. If you look up there you see all the new stuff growing into the arbor which eventually we're hoping for this whole section to be filled up."

**Timeline:**

> "I'd say in another 2 years I think we might be able to get it to cover this whole Arbor, which will be pretty spectacular."

Wisteria is noted to thrive even in heavy clay soil:

> "On this Arbor, Wisteria grows like crazy. There only year needs to be trained a little bit to get up on top."

### Lemon Arbors

A unique Valentino concept -- training citrus trees over an arch to create a fruit-bearing walk-through structure:

> "Chip and I strongly believe that if life gives you lemons, you should make a lemon arbor."

> "The horicultural green tape... We want the growth over the arbor, not beyond that. The pruning will be very logical after the tying. You're going to prune everything that doesn't lend itself to that look of lemon arbor."

> "Lemons do grow pretty fast. So, you should be able to have something that looks a little bit like a lemon arbor within 3 years."

### Arbor Materials

Arbors referenced in the transcripts are built from steel, metal-and-wood combinations, or heavy lumber:

> "This is an arbor made out of steel that has some nice FX lights on it... the arbor defines the space of the outdoor kitchen."

> "The arbor will be metal and wood."

---

## Bougainvillea

Bougainvillea appears repeatedly but with a climate caveat for Zone 9 inland valleys:

> "Buganvilia doing fantastic which more and more with a little bit warmer temperatures seems to do well in Fresno but it can be damaged by cold."

> "This buganvilia really looks good most of the year but when it gets subject to frost which we've had some 32-degree days it looks like this. In just a short time it's going to be full of leaves and blooming."

**Low-growing varieties** for foundation planting: Bambino bougainvillea is used as a compact, low-maintenance option that stays small without pruning.

---

## Boston Ivy

Boston ivy is noted as a fence-clinging vine for heavy clay soil situations:

> "Boston Ivy which grows on the fence at Wrigley Field."

Used in a residential project alongside dwarf citrus, Little John bottlebrush, and society garlic in heavy clay soil -- demonstrating its toughness.

---

## Species Selection by Sun & Shade Exposure

Valentino does not provide a single comprehensive sun/shade vine chart, but exposure considerations are woven through the project discussions:

| Vine / Climber | Exposure Notes |
|---|---|
| **Star Jasmine** | Full sun to part shade; used on all exposures in Fresno projects |
| **Trumpet Vine** | Full sun preferred; blooms best with maximum light |
| **Wisteria** | Full sun for best bloom; noted that "some of it gets too much shade" reduces flowering: "the ones that get more sun produce a good bloom" |
| **Bougainvillea** | Full sun; frost-sensitive at 32 degrees F; increasingly viable in Fresno with warming trends |
| **Creeping Fig** | Sun to shade; used on artificial concrete walls in zoo exhibits with mixed exposure |
| **Climbing Roses** | Full sun; varieties selected for "very hot summers" in Fresno |
| **Boston Ivy** | Sun to part shade; deciduous |
| **Jasmine / Ivy** | Part shade tolerant; listed for fence screening |
| **Trailing Lantana** | Full sun; used on courtyard walls facing street |

For north-facing arbors, Valentino plans for vines but emphasizes fans and lights rather than expecting heavy bloom:

> "This is a North exposure. We planned this Arbor which is going to have vines on it."

## Vine Screening for Privacy -- Quick Summary

Valentino lists the vine options for covering fences alongside shrub options:

> "Jasmine, Ivy, creeping fig -- all of those things, if you have a fence, make good green screens in addition to the fence, but usually you need some kind of support."

For situations without trellis support, free-standing evergreen shrubs (privet, xylosma, podocarpus) are preferred. When vines are used, the welded-wire-on-block-wall method is the standard approach.

## Key Principles -- Vertical Gardening Checklist

1. **Green wall over living wall.** Plant in the ground, grow up the structure. Far less expense and maintenance than modular panel living walls.
2. **Heavy gauge welded wire.** 4x4-inch squares, 16-ft panels, supported every 8 ft with eye hooks drilled into the block wall.
3. **Paint everything Dragon's Breath.** Benjamin Moore's Dragon's Breath on wire, hooks, fences, and steel edging makes hardware disappear.
4. **Horticultural green tape** to tie vines to wire initially; they will self-attach over time.
5. **Plant as close to the wire as the footing allows.** Tilt the rootball toward the wall if needed.
6. **Budget 3 years for full coverage** on climbing roses and wisteria.
7. **Prune once a year** for trumpet vine; minimal pruning for star jasmine; careful width-pruning only for climbing roses once intertwined.
8. **Match the vine to the structure's strength.** Wisteria demands heavy steel or metal-and-wood arbors. Star jasmine and climbing roses are fine on welded wire alone.
9. **Select for your exposure.** Full sun for roses, wisteria, bougainvillea, and trumpet vine. Star jasmine and creeping fig tolerate more shade.
