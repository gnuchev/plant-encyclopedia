## 1. Freeze & Cold Snap Mistakes

### Do NOT Trim After a Freeze
- **The Mistake:** Rushing to trim brown, wilted, ugly-looking plants immediately after a freeze event.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** The old, damaged growth is actually providing insulation and protection to the still-living sections underneath. Cutting it away exposes the vulnerable new growth to any additional cold snaps that may follow.
- **Correct Advice:** Wait until mid-to-late March (when all freeze danger has passed) before trimming anything. Leave the brown growth in place -- it acts as a security blanket for the plant. When you finally do trim, use hand clippers like a surgeon: scrape the stem with your fingernail to find where green tissue begins, and cut right at that line.

> "Do not trim anything. Do nothing when it comes to trimming at this point... that old growth on there normally could take tension and put effort onto the plant or the tree, but right now it's adding protection."

### Do NOT Fertilize Stressed/Dormant Plants After a Freeze
- **The Mistake:** Hearing "fertilize now" advice and immediately feeding plants that are still recovering from cold damage.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** The plants are still coming out of dormancy and are too weak to handle the push of nutrients. It overwhelms them and can cause more harm.
- **Correct Advice:** Wait until late April or early May to fertilize, once consistent warmth has returned. In the meantime, focus on: (1) increased watering, (2) liquid copper fungicide application, and (3) pesticide treatment about a week later to protect weakened plants from bug infestations.

> "A lot of times I hear people all over the place say fertilize... That's too much. You're going to really push way too much energy towards your plants and trees and they're just not ready for that. They're still kind of coming out of their dormancy."

### Freeze Prep: Water BEFORE, Stop Water Day-Of
- **The Mistake:** Not watering before a freeze, or watering on the day of the freeze and leaving moisture on leaves.
- **Correct Advice:** Water heavily the day or two before a freeze (this insulates the root system -- the water in the warm ground acts like a hot water bottle). Stop watering the day of the freeze so no water sits on the leaves, which would freeze and cause more damage. Use plant jackets, Christmas lights wrapped around sensitive plants, and the surrounding plant density to provide extra warmth.

## 2. Planting Timing Mistakes

### Do NOT Plant New Material in July/August
- **The Mistake:** Installing new plants and trees during peak summer heat (July through early September).
- **Why It Is Wrong:** The extreme heat makes it incredibly difficult to keep new plantings properly watered and hydrated while they establish. Plants experience tremendous stress during this period even when established.
- **Correct Advice:** Plant in spring (March-June) or fall (October-November) when temperatures are more moderate. If you absolutely must plant during summer, be prepared to hand-water frequently and provide extra care.

> "If you guys can avoid planting in the month of July, early August, that is a tough time to keep things watered."

## 3. Planting Technique Mistakes

### Do NOT Plant Too Deep (Root Ball Level)
- **The Mistake:** Digging the hole just deep enough to be level with the ground, or planting too low.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Over time, the backfill compresses and the plant sinks. Water pools around the base, leading to root rot -- "a slow and ugly death."
- **Correct Advice:** Plant the root ball 3-4 inches above ground level. Dig the hole shallow but three times wider than the pot. The roots spread outward first, not down, so they need width. Mound backfill (50% black cow, 25% pine bark nuggets, 25% peat moss) around the raised root ball.

### Do NOT Skip Butterflying the Root Ball
- **The Mistake:** Transplanting a plant from pot to ground without loosening the root ball.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Roots that have circled inside a pot will continue circling even in open ground. The plant becomes permanently rootbound and struggles to establish.
- **Correct Advice:** Slice around the sides with a knife, then pry the root ball open (butterfly it). Force those roots outward so they spread into the surrounding soil. For severely rootbound plants, use a machete or Hori Hori knife to break the roots apart.

> "That will not change even when you put it into that beautiful big ground filled with good soil. You have to force it open."

## 4. Design & Layout Mistakes

### Do NOT Plant in Ones and Twos
- **The Mistake:** Buying one of this, two of that, and scattering different individual plants throughout the garden.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** It creates visual chaos. The eye cannot rest. There is no rhythm, no cohesion, and the garden looks like a random collection rather than a designed space.
- **Correct Advice:** Plant in drifts (swaths/collections of the same plant grouped together). Use groupings of 3-5+ of the same plant, then break, then start a new drift of a different plant. Zigzag the plants within a drift so they grow together into one mass. Vary the heights between drifts for a waterfall layering effect.

### Never Plant a Burle Marx Solo
- **The Mistake:** Planting a single Burle Marx Philodendron as a standalone accent.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Burle Marx plants need their "brothers" -- they are meant to cluster, cascade, and connect as a group planting. A single one looks sparse and lost.
- **Correct Advice:** Always plant Burle Marx in clusters of multiple plants. They create a gorgeous, glossy-leaved "sea of green" ground cover when massed together, staying around 2.5-3 feet tall. Use them to draw curves, outline beds, and create natural tropical hedge borders.

> "They're definitely not one you want to try on single... They do need kind of a connection of their brothers with them."

### Do NOT Plant in Straight Rows
- **The Mistake:** Laying out plants in rigid, evenly-spaced straight lines (typical of builder packages and commercial installations).
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Straight rows exaggerate the length of a space, look institutional rather than tropical, and lack the depth and layering that create a garden feel.
- **Correct Advice:** Use curved beds, staggered plantings, and triangular formations. Break up long expanses into multiple bed sections with different plant groupings. Layer from tallest in the back to shortest in the front in a waterfall effect.

> "What was here was rows and rows of hedges that were straight... it just kind of over-exaggerated the length."

### Do NOT Ignore Growth Rates and Mature Sizes
- **The Mistake:** Planting without considering how large a plant or tree will ultimately get, or planting layers "backwards" with tall-growers in front of short-growers.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Fast-growing plants will block out slower-growing ones. Plants that outgrow their space require constant fighting to maintain. The layered garden aesthetic is destroyed.
- **Correct Advice:** Read the tags at the nursery. Understand mature heights. Place tallest material at the back, then step down in tiers to ground cover at the front. "Dwarf" does not mean the plant stops growing -- it means it can be maintained at a smaller size with trimming.

### Builder Package Trap: Lack of Depth/Layers
- **The Mistake:** Accepting the typical builder's landscape package as-is, which usually consists of a few trees and rows of identical shrubs with no intermediate layering.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Builder packages prioritize code compliance, not design. They miss the depth, the intermediate layers, the ground cover, and the focal points that make a garden feel tropical and lush.
- **Correct Advice:** Use the builder's material as a starting point. Relocate plants from their planted positions to better locations. Add intermediate layers, ground cover drifts, focal point trees, and backdrop plantings. Think of it as a waterfall from canopy to ground.

## 5. Wrong Plant, Wrong Place

### Do NOT Put a Shade Plant in Full Sun (or Vice Versa)
- **The Mistake:** Falling in love with a plant on Pinterest and forcing it into conditions it was not designed for (e.g., a Licuala palm in a windy, exposed location).
- **Why It Is Wrong:** The plant will constantly struggle, require far more maintenance, and may never look the way you imagined. Wind-sensitive plants in exposed areas end up with shredded leaves. Sun-loving plants in shade become leggy and weak.
- **Correct Advice:** Spend a full day mapping sun and shade patterns in your yard (morning to evening, every couple of hours). Match plants to those conditions. If you want a specific plant that does not match your conditions, first change your microclimate by installing canopy trees and wind-break plantings to create the right environment.

> "You can't -- you got to work with mother nature. It is like the perfect handshake with mother nature."

### Aggressive-Root Trees Near Pools
- **The Mistake:** Planting Bismarck palms, Royal palms, Queen palms, or Christmas palms close to pool areas.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** These species have very aggressive root systems that can damage pool decks and plumbing.
- **Correct Advice:** Use courtyard palms with soft-tip root systems near pools. Foxtail palms, bottle palms, and pygmy date palms are better choices for tight pool-side areas.

## 6. Overwatering

### Do NOT Water Every Day
- **The Mistake:** Running irrigation daily thinking "Florida plants need daily water."
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Shallow daily watering creates shallow root systems. Plants grow fast but are weak, top-heavy, and susceptible to wind damage, storms, and cold snaps. Overwatering causes browning edges, yellowing leaves, and weak stems.
- **Correct Advice:** Water 2-3 days per week with deeper soaking (35 minutes to 1 hour per zone). This forces roots to grow deep to find moisture, making plants stronger and more resilient. Signs of overwatering: yellow tone to leaves, browning edges, weak stems, and abnormally fast spindly growth.

### Do NOT Overwater Bougainvillea
- **The Mistake:** Giving bougainvillea the same watering as the rest of the tropical garden, or placing them within the main irrigation zone.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Bougainvillea bloom profusely when slightly stressed for water. Too much water produces lots of green foliage but very few blooms.
- **Correct Advice:** Water bougainvillea only every 10 days to 2 weeks. If your landscape irrigation hits them, consider planting them in pots so you can control their water independently. Full sun is essential. Trim them regularly -- they bloom only on new growth, so every cut produces two new stems with future blooms.

> "Don't overwater your Bougainvillea. Make sure they're in the sun."

## 7. Pruning & Trimming Mistakes

### Do NOT Over-Prune (Every Cut Is an Open Sore)
- **The Mistake:** Trimming and nipping at the garden every weekend to "keep it looking nice."
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Every single cut creates an open wound that invites disease, pests, and bugs. Constant pruning weakens the plant and makes it more susceptible to infestations.
- **Correct Advice:** Prune on a quarterly schedule: March, June, September, and December (every 60-90 days). This gives plants enough time to flush out between trimmings and stay healthy. Resist the urge to touch up between these intervals unless there is an obvious dead or broken limb.

> "Think of this: every time that you prune, you allow kind of an open sore for disease or pest or bugs to come in."

### Do NOT Use Hedge Trimmers on Tropical Plants
- **The Mistake:** Having lawn services blast through tropical plants with power hedge trimmers.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Hedge trimmers leave brown, damaged edges on large-leafed tropicals. The cut leaves look terrible, and the damage points become entry points for pests and disease. It only clips the outer surface without properly shaping or opening up the interior of the plant.
- **Correct Advice:** Hand-prune tropical plants with clippers. Yes, it takes longer (an hour vs. 20 minutes), but the results are dramatically better -- clean cuts, rounded shapes, no brown edges, and much healthier plants that flush out beautifully. Save hedge trimmers only for needle-type plants or true hedges.

> "I see them all the time in big communities... those brown edges... that harsh line... leaves it susceptible to pest and bugs and disease."

### Do NOT Over-Trim Palm Trees
- **The Mistake:** Aggressively trimming green fronds from palm trees to create a "clean" look, or "hurricane cutting" palms too far back.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Green fronds are still feeding the tree. Each cut is a wound. Removing too many fronds weakens the palm and stresses it.
- **Correct Advice:** With palm trees, normally only cut fronds that are fully brown and dead. The exception: before a hurricane, you can remove some lower fronds to reduce wind sail, but otherwise, leave the green fronds alone.

> "With palm trees, don't cut it if it's still green."

## 8. Weed Barrier / Weed Matting Mistakes

### Do NOT Put Weed Matting Under Mulch
- **The Mistake:** Laying weed barrier fabric under mulched landscape beds, thinking it will prevent weeds.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Mulch is designed to break down over time and enrich the soil beneath it. With weed matting underneath, the decomposing mulch just sits on top of the plastic, creating a perfect seedbed for blown-in weed seeds. Meanwhile, the barrier restricts water from reaching plant roots. You end up with more weeds, not fewer, and unhealthy plants.
- **Correct Advice:** Use weed barrier ONLY under stone/rock beds and walkways where it serves a structural purpose (keeping rock in place, preventing it from sinking). In mulched planting beds, skip the weed barrier entirely. Dense, grouped plantings and proper mulch depth will suppress weeds naturally. When re-mulching, rake out old decomposed mulch first, then apply fresh.

> "If you put mulch over top of weed barrier, it does the exact same thing -- it breaks down, but then it becomes a pretty much weed bed for new seedlings... save your money and your time on not doing that."

## 9. Fertilization Mistakes

### Do NOT Skip Fertilization
- **The Mistake:** Believing that tropical plants in Florida do not need fertilizer because "they thrive in this climate naturally."
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Unfertilized plants are dramatically more susceptible to pest attacks. A University of Michigan study showed that 99% of pests attacked unhealthy (unfertilized) plants, while only 1% attacked the healthy (fertilized) ones -- and even those pests quickly moved on because they could not digest the healthy tissue.
- **Correct Advice:** Fertilize four times per year with a granular tropical fertilizer (she uses Palm Gain 8-2-12). Simply broadcast it into the open areas of mulch around your plants and trees. This is the single best "immunity shot" you can give your garden, dramatically reducing the need for pesticide treatments.

> "You need to fertilize your plants and trees for one big reason. It fights off the pest. It's like the best immunity shot that you can give your plants or your trees."

## 10. Bromeliad Mounting Mistakes

### Do NOT Mount Bromeliads Straight Up on Trees
- **The Mistake:** Attaching bromeliads to tree trunks in a straight-up vertical position, just as you would plant them in the ground.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Bromeliads have cup-shaped centers that catch water. When mounted vertically, water sits in the cups and does not drain, creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes and potentially rotting the plant.
- **Correct Advice:** Mount bromeliads at an angle (tilted outward, like they are "shooting out and saying hello"). This allows rainwater to fill the cups and then drain out naturally. Use zip ties (not wire or fishing line) to secure them to the tree. Zip ties stretch as the plant grows and eventually disintegrate.

> "Try not to put them straight up like you see here. Try to put them at an angle... that'll really help not getting mosquitoes and not causing water to sit."

## 11. Queen Palm Problems

### Avoid Queen Palms in New Installations
- **The Mistake:** Using Queen Palms as a standard palm tree choice for new landscapes.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Queen Palms have had widespread fungus issues and disease problems in recent years. They are no longer a reliable long-term investment for Florida landscapes.
- **Correct Advice:** Consider Mule Palms (a cross between Pindo palm and Queen palm) instead -- they inherit the cold tolerance and beautiful canopy of the Queen Palm without the disease susceptibility. Foxtail Palms, Fishtail Palms, and other species are more reliable alternatives.

> "The queen palm has had its share of troubles... it's had fungus issues. It's had problems over the last few years. So, it's definitely not a palm that I incorporate anymore into gardens."

## 12. Small Heliconia Mistake

### Do NOT Plant Small/Dwarf Heliconia Varieties
- **The Mistake:** Buying the small 3-gallon heliconias commonly found at Home Depot or Lowe's.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** The small-stemmed varieties are aggressive spreaders that will take over your garden beds and become impossible to control.
- **Correct Advice:** Plant only the large, clumping varieties of heliconia. These stay contained and do not spread aggressively. Use them as backdrop plants since they only bloom about 3 months per year.

> "The ones with the small stems, those can be scary in the garden. So, you kind of want to avoid planting those at all costs."

---

## 13. Landscape Service / Contractor Mistakes

### Demand Hand-Tagging of Material
- **The Mistake:** Allowing a landscape contractor to simply order generic material from a nursery without personally selecting each plant and tree.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Plants of the same species and container size can vary wildly in quality, shape, height, and health. Without hand-selection, you may get the runts of the batch.
- **Correct Advice:** Make sure your designer or contractor is physically going to the nursery and tagging (selecting) each individual plant and tree. They should be picking the prettiest, healthiest specimens and ensuring visual consistency across groupings.

### Builder Package Pitfalls
- **The Mistake:** Assuming the builder's landscape package is a finished garden.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** Builder packages are mass-planted entry-level landscapes: a row of shrubs, a few trees, minimal variety, no layering, no focal points, and often plants in the wrong locations for long-term success.
- **Correct Advice:** Treat the builder package as raw material. Relocate plants to better positions. Add layers, depth, focal points, and ground cover. If possible, negotiate with the builder before installation to substitute specific plants from a preferred list.

### Lawn Services: Hedge Trimming Everything
- **The Mistake:** Lawn maintenance crews use hedge trimmers on all plant material because it is fast and efficient.
- **Why It Is Wrong:** This creates brown-edged, flat-topped plants that are susceptible to disease and never develop the rounded, lush, natural tropical shape. Large-leafed tropicals like Clusia, Sea Grape, and Crotons look especially terrible when hedge-trimmed.
- **Correct Advice:** Hand-prune tropical plants quarterly. The difference in appearance and plant health is dramatic. If you hire a garden service, specify hand-pruning for your tropical plants.

## 14. Miscellaneous Warnings

### Droppings from Certain Trees
- Some trees (like certain Syzygium varieties) produce berry droppings. Consider this when planting near walkways, driveways, or pool decks to avoid messy cleanup issues.

### Fishing Line for Mounting
- **Never use fishing line** to attach orchids or bromeliads to trees. It does not stretch, does not disintegrate, and can eventually damage the plant. Use zip ties instead.

### Rock Beds and Rust in Water
- If you have rust (iron) in your well water, **avoid using white or light-colored decorative rock** in your beds. The irrigation will stain the rock an ugly tan/orange over time.

### Planning a Debris Area
- When designing a dense tropical garden, plan a hidden area behind your buffer planting where you can stash fallen fronds, clippings, and debris between pickup days. Without this, you will constantly fight with where to put garden waste.

### Weed Control Before Planting
- Before installing a new landscape, take the time to kill existing weeds (including aggressive root systems) with multiple rounds of treatment. Weeds grow faster than new plants and will overwhelm a young garden if not addressed first.

### Drip Line Monitoring
- Drip irrigation lines can fail silently. Plants can be dying before you notice a problem. Check drip lines regularly (at least seasonally in April when doing spring cleanup).

### Storm/Hurricane Preparation
- Before a storm: walk through your garden and remove any dead limbs in tree canopies (even some green lower ones) to reduce wind sail. Cut bougainvillea, hibiscus, and bottle brush trees way back. Stake any newer or wobbly trees with 2x4 bracing. Every storm, the biggest mess comes from dead wood that becomes projectiles.
