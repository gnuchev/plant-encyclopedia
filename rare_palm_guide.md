## Overview

The designer identifies a consistent theme among rare/specialty palms: most grow exceptionally slow, which is a major reason they are rare in nurseries. Growers cannot produce them quickly, so inventory is limited. The slow growth is also a design advantage -- these palms stay where you put them and maintain scale in the landscape for years. She recommends sourcing from nurseries in Palm City, Stuart, Homestead, and Plant Ant (Plant City) in Florida, and along the Treasure and Space Coasts.

## 1. Carpoxylon (Carpoxylon macrospermum)

**The designer's self-described top favorite palm in her entire garden.**

### Growth Rate
- **Super slow.** Planted at 9-10 ft tall, after 8-9 years they are just now showing their full potential. The last 2 years of that period is when they really started to "show off." From small to large takes many years.

### Cold Tolerance
- Does not like freeze temperatures. Anything 32 degrees F and warmer is ideal. Not suitable for areas with regular freezes.

### Mature Size
- Will reach 27-30 ft, but it will take "years and years and years" to get there.

### Appearance
- Beautiful prominent green crown shaft -- described as "absolutely a stunner."
- Very compact, vertical canopy. Fronds pop up vertically then do "a slight bend at the edge of the leaf like a curtsy" -- an elegant curl at the tips.
- Dark green trunk that transitions to a "cane roped base."
- At the very bottom, the trunk opens up like an elephant's foot -- bulbous base reminiscent of a ponytail palm base.
- Described as a mix of King Alexander + Royal Palm + Bottle Palm characteristics all in one.
- No thorns.
- Leaves are always "the perfect kind of green."

### Self-Cleaning
- Technically self-cleaning, but fronds take a very long time to release/drop. The designer recommends trimming brown fronds yourself rather than waiting. Not a heavy canopy frond base, so trimming is minimal.

### Design Use / Placement
- **Focal point / specimen tree** -- stands on its own as a unique species.
- Ideal for: entrance palms on either side of a walkway, corner of a house, feature palm.
- Can fit in more compact spaces because the canopy stays vertical with that curl rather than spreading wide.
- Works well just above a roof line for canopy framing.
- Described as "finicky" -- pick them up young, put them exactly where you want them, and let them grow.

### Sourcing & Cost
- **Pricey** -- "big budget for a small tree" -- but "worth their weight in gold."
- Available in Palm City, Stuart, Homestead, Florida areas.
- If you find one, even small, "pick it up."
- For clients: the designer notes it is not as much of a showpiece when first brought in because the investment is large relative to the initial visual impact. She leaves it up to clients but recommends patience.

### Warnings / Special Care
- Grows so slow you may "forget about it" in the yard.
- Requires patience -- the return on investment is long-term.
- Fertilize with 8-2-12 palm gain fertilizer quarterly (March, June, September, and December if warm).

## 2. Pinanga Coronata (Ivory Cane Palm)

### Growth Rate
- **Slow grower.** However, the designer notes hers grew more than expected in its first year -- possibly 2 ft of growth -- attributed to excellent backfill soil preparation. Stays compact for a long period of time.

### Cold Tolerance
- Can handle Zone 10A temperatures. Needs protection from severe cold, but with proper fertilization (8-2-12 quarterly), the designer reports no problems with cold temps or pests. Handles cold better than its cousin the Lipstick Palm.

### Mature Size
- Small palm. Stays narrow and vertical. Multi-trunk clustering habit. Will multiply trunks over a very long time.

### Appearance
- Beautiful white canes (hence "Ivory Cane Palm").
- Multi-trunk clustering palm -- individual trunks bouquet together in the middle.
- Fronds stay very close together, layered "leaf on leaf" -- very vertical and compact.
- Tighter, broader limbs than Eureka or Cat palms, which tend to widen out and open up. Pinanga stays much more vertical and narrow.
- Unique leaf structure -- "I don't think there's really anything that replicates that."
- Related to the Lipstick Palm (a cousin) but without the red crown shafts. Described as a "lookalike version without the red cane."

### Self-Cleaning
- Not specifically noted as self-cleaning. Yellow/brown leaves should be clipped as close to the palm base as possible with loppers or nippers.

### Design Use / Placement
- **Courtyard palm, narrow planters, nooks, wall accents, screen room surrounds.**
- Perfect for tight spaces -- stays narrow and does not outgrow its area.
- Ideal alongside walls in 3-ft planters.
- Can handle a lot of palm in a little space because it won't widen out.
- Use as understory palm -- needs protection from direct sun. Prefers morning sun into full shade; can handle full shade.
- Contrasts beautifully with broader-leafed palms (e.g., lacuala). Layering different frond textures creates depth.
- Used by the designer in courtyard garden settings, placed as pairs on each side of a walkway.

### Sourcing & Cost
- Not explicitly priced, but noted as a specialty palm that is a "rare find."
- Available at Florida nurseries along the Treasure Coast.

### Warnings / Special Care
- Needs shade protection from harsh sun. Will struggle in full direct sun without overhead canopy from larger palms.
- Thrives as an undergrowth palm beneath taller trees (triangle palms, coconuts, areca palms).
- Fertilize with 8-2-12 palm gain quarterly (March, June, September, December).
- You can manage height by removing center trunks without harming the plant -- individual pups survive on their own.
- Creates pups that stay tight to the trunk; can be removed or left to grow.

## 3. Copernicia Fallaensis

**Bryce's (the designer's son/cameraman) favorite palm in their whole yard. Originally from Cuba.**

### Growth Rate
- **Very slow.** About 1 ft to 1.5 ft per year. In 4 years in the ground, the designer's specimen put on maybe a foot and a half.

### Cold Tolerance
- Not specifically noted for cold hardiness. Used in Zone 10A (Vero Beach). Focus is more on wind tolerance concerns.

### Mature Size
- Will grow into the 30 ft range, but "I'll be long and gone by the time this guy gets that way" -- takes decades.

### Appearance
- Big giant fan-like fronds -- a fan palm species.
- Very vertical, very upright at the trunk. Stays compact at the center.
- Unlike Bismarck palms (which spread at the canopy from the trunk), Copernicia stays real vertical to the trunk itself.
- Fans almost interlock with each other as they open and bloom.
- Top-heavy: the crown/canopy is often taller than the trunk itself, giving it a unique inverted proportion look.
- Even at small sizes (6-7 ft), it is a "stunner right off the bat."

### Self-Cleaning
- **Not self-cleaning.** Old fronds must be lopped off. As the tree gets bigger, a maintenance company will be needed to trim. Similar maintenance to Bismarck palms.

### Design Use / Placement
- **Centerpiece / standout feature palm.**
- Ideal for front yard focal points or corner backyard garden features.
- "One will do the job" -- very few palms in Florida where a single specimen makes the full impact you need.
- Frame it with curved foxtail palms around the sides.
- Perfect for someone's front yard or a corner backyard garden.
- She uses it where she needs a "standout feature" for a client.

### Sourcing & Cost
- **Rare palm, somewhat pricey, and a little hard to find.**
- Available along the Treasure and Space Coast nurseries.
- From Cuba originally.
- You do not need many -- one makes the impact.

### Warnings / Special Care
- **Wind vulnerability is a major concern.** The compact, tight fans act as wind sails. Can blow over or lay crooked in hurricanes or heavy storms.
- **Must be staked with 4 stakes and rebar** from the time of planting, even years after installation. The designer still has straps on hers after years in the ground.
- Top-heavy when young (more canopy than trunk) -- this makes staking critical.
- Heavy palm fertilizer is essential to build a solid, dense trunk and heavily rooted base. Use 8-2-12 palm gain.
- "Rather expensive" -- protect your investment with proper staking and fertilizing.
- Do not trim back fronds to compensate for wind risk -- keep the palm healthy by keeping its fronds.

## 4. Kentiopsis (Kentiopsis oliviformis)

**One of the designer's absolute favorites. She uses it frequently in landscape designs.**

### Growth Rate
- **Slow to moderate.** About 1.5 to 2 ft per year -- slightly faster than the other rare palms discussed but still considered slow for a Florida palm. "Middle of the row when it comes to growth."

### Cold Tolerance
- **Very cold tolerant for a tropical palm.** Can handle temperatures down into the low 20s F. The designer notes it can go into the low 30s with no issues, and in another passage says into the 20s. Suitable for all of Florida including north Florida. Not recommended for extended cold periods (e.g., Georgia or Carolinas for prolonged freezes).

### Mature Size
- Will reach approximately 20-24 ft range depending on soil types.

### Appearance
- Beautiful upright canopy with stiff, dynamic fronds.
- Fronds are notably wide and broad for a small-framed tree -- "magnanimous... so big and so broad for such a small frame tree."
- More vertical, dynamic, and upright than a foxtail. Not wavy, soft, or lacy -- described as "aggressive" fronds.
- Small base/trunk relative to canopy size -- gives a lot of bang for the buck.
- "Getting big in popularity" -- increasingly appearing on construction entrances and projects.
- People often mistake it for a King Alexander but it has a distinctly different look.

### Self-Cleaning
- Technically self-cleaning, but practically the designer recommends trimming brown fronds. Self-cleaning occurs after a long period when the weight of dead fronds causes them to release, but this takes too long. Most of the time, just cut the brown limbs.

### Design Use / Placement
- **Palm alleys / driveway flanking** -- alternated with foxtail palms (small Kentiopsis, tall foxtail, small Kentiopsis, tall foxtail) for an up-and-down rhythm that creates grand entrance style.
- **Anchoring palm** -- centerpiece tree, corner anchor.
- **Showpiece tree** at construction entrances and front landscapes.
- Pairs beautifully with foxtail palms because the canopies never compete -- the Kentiopsis frond is completely different from the foxtail's fluffy top.
- "Nice compact tree that you can fit into a tight space."
- Can handle full sun, filtered light, sandy soils, and some moisture.

### Sourcing & Cost
- **Hard to find.** At one of the designer's main nurseries (a huge palm nursery with thousands of foxtails and queens), there was only one row of Kentiopsis left with barely any available.
- Available in 30-gallon, 45-gallon pots or field-grown.
- The designer notes she does not get to use this tree as often as she would like due to limited availability.

### Warnings / Special Care
- Can become potassium deficient -- needs regular 8-2-12 palm gain fertilizer 4 times per year.
- In potted nursery settings they look gorgeous and dark green because they are well-fertilized. In the ground, they need attention to keep that dark green color.
- Use good compost at planting.

## 5. Cold Coconut Palm / Alfred Palm

**Also called: Alfred Palm, Cold Coconut. NOT a true coconut palm -- not related to coconut at all.**

### Growth Rate
- **Super slow.** Grows 6 inches to a maximum of 1 ft per year in perfect conditions. The designer describes a specimen that barely outgrew a wall after almost 20 years.

### Cold Tolerance
- **Extremely cold hardy.** Can handle temperatures down into the 20s F without blinking. Suitable for Jacksonville, Cocoa, Merritt Island, and areas of Florida that get cold snaps. One of the most cold-tolerant palms discussed.

### Mature Size
- Gets large eventually (see 20-year-old established specimen), but it takes decades. Dense, thick canopy.

### Appearance
- Very similar elongated leaf to a coconut palm -- hence the nickname "cold coconut."
- Bottle-like base at the trunk bottom.
- Canopy opens up and branches out nice and wide. Dense, thick coverage.
- Does NOT produce coconuts (a major selling point for pool/hammock areas).
- Beautiful sound when the breeze blows through the fronds.

### Self-Cleaning
- Not specifically discussed. Appears to be relatively low-maintenance due to slow growth.

### Design Use / Placement
- **Privacy screening / neighbor blocking** -- dense canopy stays at the right height for a long time.
- Near pools and hammock areas -- no coconut drop risk.
- Shade creation -- used to build canopy for underplantings.
- Pairs with pygmy date palms, bamboo plantings, and tropical underplantings.
- Works as a buffer planting along property lines.
- Versatile: can grow in shade, sun, cold, heat.
- Available at typical nurseries in 15-gallon, 25-gallon, 45-gallon, and field-grown sizes.

### Sourcing & Cost
- Readily available at typical nurseries compared to some other rare palms. Available in standard container sizes.

### Warnings / Special Care
- "Stays where you put it" -- plan the location carefully since it grows so slowly you are committed for years.
- Use good compost and 8-2-12 palm gain fertilizer.

## 6. Mule Palm (Butiagrus nabonnandii)

**A hybrid cross between the Pindo Palm (Butia) and the Queen Palm (Syagrus).**

### Growth Rate
- **Very slow.** 6 inches to a maximum of 1 ft per year.

### Cold Tolerance
- **Very cold tolerant** -- inherits cold hardiness from both parents. Can handle temperatures into the 20s F. Suitable from the Florida Keys all the way up into the Georgia area.

### Mature Size
- Short trunk with a big frond canopy -- the ratio stays more canopy than trunk throughout its life.

### Appearance
- Short bulbous base at the bottom.
- Most of the tree is frond/canopy rather than trunk.
- Very dark green coloring to the leaf.
- Fabulous intermediate tree -- fills the space between understory and tall canopy palms.

### Self-Cleaning
- Not specifically mentioned. Likely requires occasional trimming like its parent species.

### Design Use / Placement
- **Ideal intermediate tree** for long-term coverage.
- Perfect for blocking roof lines when you want dense canopy with a clean understory.
- Get one with about 4 ft of clearance and the canopy stays dense above that for a long time.
- Combine with taller palm trees as an intermediate layer.

### Sourcing & Cost
- **Hard to find / rare.** At a huge palm nursery, only one row remained with barely any available. Classified as rare primarily due to slow nursery production.

### Warnings / Special Care
- Can become nutrient deficient easily if soil is poor. Use good compost at planting.
- Fertilize regularly with 8-2-12 palm gain.
- The designer no longer uses straight Queen Palms due to fungus issues in recent years, but this hybrid has "taken to its own" without those problems.

## 7. Pindo Palm / Jelly Palm (Butia capitata) -- Multi-Trunk Variety

**Not technically a rare species, but multi-trunk specimens are uncommon finds.**

### Growth Rate
- **Super slow.** About 1 ft per year in good conditions. Trimming needed only once a year or even once every two years.

### Cold Tolerance
- **Extremely cold hardy.** Can handle freezing temperatures. Planted successfully all the way into Georgia and South Carolina.

### Mature Size
- Moderate. Multi-trunk varieties stay more vertical and linear than singles.

### Appearance
- Silverish tone to the leaf -- shows off nicely against green gardens.
- Multi-trunk varieties (triple, double, quad) cause the canopy to be more vertical and straight rather than the typical bouquet spread of single-trunk specimens.
- Diamond-cut boot pattern on trunk when trimmed at an angle.

### Self-Cleaning
- **Not self-cleaning.** Must be cut. Can use loppers or a saw, cutting boots at an angle for a diamond-cut decorative trunk look.

### Design Use / Placement
- Perfect anchor tree for property corners, side-yard entrances, driveway approaches.
- Multi-trunk specimens are the rare/specialty finds.

### Sourcing
- Singles are common, but triple and quad multi-trunk specimens are rare finds.

## 8. Eureka Palm (Dypsis pembana)

**Not classified as rare but frequently used in the designer's work as a specialty/high-impact palm.**

### Growth Rate
- **Fast.** Gives "a lot of impact pretty much right away."

### Appearance
- Clustering palm with bamboo-like trunks/stocks.
- Can be left full, thick, and dense, or trimmed up to reveal the bamboo-like trunk structure.
- Deep green in shaded areas. Long arching branches, wispy and floaty.
- Very vertical growth habit -- can fit in relatively tight spots.

### Design Use / Placement
- Backdrop planting -- lined across the back of gardens.
- Trimmed up at the bottom with a full canopy on top, or left natural and dense.
- Full shade to filtered light -- deeper green and nicer in shade.
- In Zone 10A or warmer.
- Fronds used in floral arrangements -- cut way down for a lacy look in large vases.
- Makes a "perfect backdrop" behind feature plantings like Queen Emma, Burle Marx, etc.

### Maintenance Note
- Requires regular maintenance -- trimming/clipping about every 3 months.
- "Gets a lot of hate" from people who do not want to do maintenance. Not for set-and-forget gardeners.
- If you are on the north side of the house with less harsh sun, they will be greener and nicer.

## 9. Dune Palm

The Dune Palm is mentioned briefly as a container centerpiece palm used in a potted arrangement. The designer placed it as a centerpiece in a large pot flanked by imperialis bromeliads and margaret bromeliads. No detailed rare/specialty discussion is provided beyond its use as a design accent piece in container plantings.

## Common Themes Across Rare Palms

| Palm | Growth Rate | Cold Tolerance | Mature Height | Self-Cleaning |
|------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Carpoxylon | Super slow | 32 F+ (no freeze) | 27-30 ft | Technically yes, but trim recommended |
| Pinanga Coronata | Slow | Zone 10A, needs protection | Small/multi-trunk | No (clip brown leaves) |
| Copernicia Fallaensis | Very slow (~1-1.5 ft/yr) | Zone 10A | 30 ft | No (must lop fronds) |
| Kentiopsis | Slow-moderate (~1.5-2 ft/yr) | Low 20s F | 20-24 ft | Technically yes, but trim recommended |
| Cold Coconut / Alfred | Super slow (6 in - 1 ft/yr) | Low 20s F | Large (20+ years) | Not discussed |
| Mule Palm | Very slow (6 in - 1 ft/yr) | Low 20s F | Intermediate | Not discussed |
| Pindo (multi-trunk) | Slow (~1 ft/yr) | Freezing temps (GA/SC) | Moderate | No |

### Universal Care Recommendations
- **Fertilizer:** 8-2-12 palm gain fertilizer, applied quarterly (March, June, September, December).
- **Soil:** Use quality compost/backfill at planting for best establishment.
- **Staking:** Large fan palms (Copernicia) and top-heavy specimens must be staked with rebar -- especially in hurricane-prone areas.
- **Patience:** The designer repeatedly emphasizes that rare palms reward patience. They are expensive for their initial size, but over years they become irreplaceable showpieces.

### Where to Source Rare Palms in Florida
- Palm City, FL
- Stuart, FL
- Homestead, FL
- Plant City ("Plant Ant" in transcript), FL
- Nurseries along the Treasure Coast and Space Coast
- Ask local nurseries if they can special-order specimens they do not stock
- Plant Ant (likely Plant City) noted as "a fantastic resource to find some of these exotic palm trees"
