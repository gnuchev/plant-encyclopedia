## Design Philosophy: The Small Pallet Principle

John Valentino's most repeated and foundational design principle is what he calls the **small plant pallet** -- using a limited number of plant varieties deployed boldly through massing and repetition, rather than one of everything.

> "What we like to do is not use one plant here and one plant there, but come up with a fairly small plant pallet and then use it in bold ways. When you mass plants, you really are affording yourself a real look into their beauty because when they bloom, they bloom all together and they make quite an impact."

### Core Rules for Plant Combinations

| Principle | John's Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Simplicity over variety** | "We would encourage you to try to err on the side of simplicity rather than err on the side of giving everyone a headache that drives by your house." |
| **Massing in odd numbers** | "We try to do everything in masses. Garden like this that isn't formal would usually do it in odd numbers." |
| **Repetition throughout** | Use the same plant types "over and over throughout the rest of the garden" -- on both sides of driveways, along walks, throughout beds. |
| **Small pallet, bold deployment** | "When doing plant combinations... we don't want it to give you a headache. So we want some continuity in the planting. We're trying to come up with a plant pallet that doesn't have 30 plants in it." |
| **Natural form** | "I prefer to try to pick plants that you don't have to prune all the time and let them grow their natural form rather than -- I call this clubbing them into submission." |
| **Right size for the spot** | "We want pretty for 20 years, not pretty for a day." Avoid impulse purchases of plants that outgrow their location. |

---

## Color Theory & Combinations

John's approach to color is notably personal and permissive -- but grounded in a few practical strategies.

> "Many like to worry about color combinations and some entire gardens are designed on specific color combinations. You know, I think color combinations are pretty personal. You could put every garish color together and come up with a pretty spectacular look. All of it is personal taste, in my opinion, and all valid."

> "The way the results are the most spectacular is if your plants are healthy and if your blooms are profuse and you see the real beauty of the flower. So whatever color combination you prefer, the real key is healthy soil."

### John's Color Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Color theme** | Pick 1-3 colors and mass them | White + purple trailing lantana |
| **Massing color** | "I would probably pick one or two colors just because I like to do massing of colors" | One color of lantana per area |
| **Contrasting focal points** | Use a striking color contrast at key viewing points | Marmalade Sky roses (orange) contrasted with Iceberg roses (white) behind |
| **Foliage color variety** | In shade gardens where blooms are sparse, vary leaf colors | "If all your foliage plants were this shade of green, it's kind of boring. But if you work in foliage plants that have different colors of leaves, then you start to get something a little more interesting." |
| **Leaf color + bloom** | Combine plants valued for leaf color with bloom plants | Salvia + liriope (variegated) + dianella |
| **The "zigzag"** | Distribute color throughout the garden in a flowing pattern | "I take the colors and sprinkle them throughout. They kind of zigzag. If you look at the colors all combined, they work well together." |

### Proven Color Pairings from John's Work

| Pairing | Effect |
|---|---|
| White + purple trailing lantana | "It's compelling. It's beautiful. It lasts almost all summer." |
| Marmalade Sky floribunda (orange) + Iceberg roses (white) | "I love that color especially contrasted with the Iceberg roses behind it." |
| Iceberg roses (white) + agapanthus (dark blue) | "Roses and agapanthus do frequently bloom at the same time -- those are Iceberg roses so they're going to be white and then agapanthus dark bluish." |
| Lavender lantana + white lantana + Ice Cap roses (white) | "We chose the lavender and the white. And then the Ice Cap roses here right behind. They are stunning." |
| Blue hydrangeas + pink dogwood | "Those probably will be blooming about the same time and those colors go together well." |
| Bougainvillea (blush pink) + dark-leafed crepe myrtles | "Totally different and subtle and with the very dark leaves, it's just gorgeous." |
| Iceland poppies (mixed) + kopia (green ground cover) | "A combination of kopia and fully blooming Iceland poppies" for spring entrance color. |

## Height Layering & Plant Architecture

John consistently builds landscapes in layers. The general structure from his garden tours:

### The Four-Layer Model

| Layer | Role | Example Plants |
|---|---|---|
| **Canopy Trees** (20+ ft) | Shade, structure, value | Chinese Pistache (Keith Davey), Southern Live Oak, Fruitless Olives (multi-trunk), Ginkgo |
| **Small Trees / Large Shrubs** (8-15 ft) | Screening, mid-canopy, focal points | Japanese Maples, Crepe Myrtles (Natchez), Eastern/Western Redbud, Raphiolepis Majestic Beauty, Texas Privet, Podocarpus |
| **Mid Shrubs** (3-6 ft) | Body of the garden, screening, background | Russelia St. Elmo's Fire, Nandina Flirt, Dwarf Olive (Little Ollie), Camellia Sasanqua Setsugekka, Salvia, Santa Barbara Salvia |
| **Foreground / Ground Cover** (under 2 ft) | Carpet, border, finish | Kopia (Coprosma), Juniper Procumbens Nana, Variegated Liriope, Dianella, Agapanthus Queen Anne, Dwarf Agave Blue Glow, Dymondia, Asian Jasmine |

### Layering Principles

> "You need to think about the heights and the sizes of everything and then the colors and then the textures and maybe get some combinations of things that are interesting visually -- not all the same shade of green."

> "In front of the ginger we'll use lower things that will fill in over time."

- **Background (tallest):** Screen fences and boundaries with privet, Carolina cherry, or podocarpus
- **Mid-ground:** Body plantings of salvia, nandina, russelia for structure and color
- **Foreground (lowest):** Low ground covers, liriope, dianella for finish and border

## Mediterranean / Drought-Tolerant Palette

John's approach to Mediterranean and drought-tolerant gardens draws from both California natives and plants from similar climates worldwide.

> "Rather than limit it to just native plants, there's other plants from other parts of the world that also do good in a hot dry Mediterranean climate. I like to use all of those together rather than saying I'm only going to use California natives. Olive trees and rosemary and a whole host of other plants that grow in Mediterranean climates which means they don't get summer water -- and many of them are perfectly suited to our climate here in California. So I kind of mix California natives for our area with exotic plants that have similar requirements."

> "Focus on a plant pallet made up of California natives or if you're not in California, wherever you're native to, and Mediterranean plants that do well without water in their native habitat."

### The Mediterranean Xeriscape Recipe

| Layer | Plants | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Trees** | Fruitless Olives (multi-trunk), Chinese Pistache (Keith Davey), Southern Live Oak | Low-water once established; olives pruned to show trunk structure |
| **Large Screening** | Texas Privet, Carolina Cherry, Dwarf Olive (Little Ollie) | Block wall screening; grow to 4-6 ft+ |
| **Mid Shrubs** | Salvia greggii (Mirage Blue, Mirage Purple), Salvia leucantha, Santa Barbara Salvia, Russelia St. Elmo's Fire, Butterfly Bush | "The only plants here are tough things like Lantana, Salvia, Rosemary" |
| **Accent** | Red Hesperaloe, Yucca filamentosa Color Guard, Agave Blue Glow | Architectural accents; very low water |
| **Low/Ground** | Kopia (Coprosma), Dymondia, Lantana (white and lavender trailing), Rosemary (Tuscan Blue) | "This stand of kopia... stays green" year-round |
| **Edging / Rock** | Mexican Cobble, California Gold gravel, Decomposed Granite, Desert Gold Rock | "Some people associate it with kind of a Mediterranean maybe native plant look where the plants are a little sparer and don't use a lot of water and rock is the ground cover." |

### Key Salvia Varieties John Uses

| Variety | Description |
|---|---|
| Salvia greggii 'Mirage Blue' | "Really a favorite of mine... the leaves stay lush, it doesn't get real big, stays low, blooms like crazy all the time except in the middle of winter, and has a really nice looking vivid bloom." |
| Salvia greggii 'Mirage Purple' | Slightly different violet hue; pairs with Mirage Blue |
| Salvia leucantha (Mexican Bush Sage) | Larger; purple spikes; used for screening layers |
| Santa Barbara Salvia (dwarf) | "They've just exploded in this beautiful color of theirs." |

---

## Shade Garden Palette

John's shade planting approach begins with assessing what changed in the garden's light exposure, then selecting a coordinated palette of mostly foliage plants.

> "Things like dogwoods will grow in Fresno. We're going to plant one right over there, a pink dogwood. Different plants like the variegated ginger, two kinds of Japanese aralia, some autumn ferns and a lady fern, some hydrangeas, couple other things."

> "It's kind of a fairly simple plant pallet. Ginger, philodendron, fern, worked in informal groupings."

### Shade Garden Bed Recipe (Pool Garden Makeover)

| Layer | Plant | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Focal Tree** | Pink Dogwood (Cornus florida) | Centerpiece; blooms in shade |
| **Background Tall** | Variegated Ginger Lily | "As a background plant... a nice contrast in color with the variegated ginger." |
| **Background Screening** | Japanese Aralia (green + Spider Web variegated) | Screen fence and pool equipment; "these big Japanese aralia" |
| **Background Screening** | Privet | For road screening where some western sun exists |
| **Mid** | Blue Hydrangeas | "Three hydrangeas... for a little color" |
| **Mid** | Xanadu Philodendron | Three grouped with autumn ferns |
| **Low / Foreground** | Autumn Fern | "Around the dogwood... grouping of three" |
| **Low / Foreground** | Silver Lady Fern | "An interesting silver lady, which is a neat looking fern" |
| **Ground** | Ginger Lily (small) | "Here and there to fill in places that need just a little bit more finish" |

### Additional Shade-Tolerant Combinations from Garden Tours

| Combination | Context |
|---|---|
| Mexican Heather (Cuphea) + Blue Lily Turf (Liriope) + Dwarf White Loropetalum + Sea Lavender | Shade side of xeriscape garden walk |
| Green Japanese Maple (15-20 yr old multi-trunk) + dwarf thyme + oxalis | Under-canopy planting; "a nice little yellow color there to the bluish purple bloom of the creeping thyme" |
| Japanese Aralia + Agapanthus + Japanese Maples + Redbuds + Annuals (alyssum) | Back border of estate garden under ginkgos |
| Rhododendron + Japanese Maple (green) + Grapefruit | Unusual Fresno shade garden with moisture |

## Asian / Tropical-Inspired Palette

### Fresno Chaffee Zoo Asian Exhibit

John landscaped an Asian animal exhibit at the Fresno Chaffee Zoo using primarily plants native to Asia. This provides a master list for an Asian-themed planting.

> "There's a focus here on Asian plants in terms of their native habitat and that was by design because it's an Asian exhibit."

| Plant | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Star Jasmine | Vine/ground cover | Cascading over walls |
| Bougainvillea | Vine | Growing up walls via welded wire trellis |
| Bamboo (multiple kinds) | Screen / structural | "Lots of bamboo of different kinds" |
| Ginger Lily | Perennial | Multiple varieties |
| Palms (couple different kinds) | Tree / accent | Tropical canopy |
| Bananas | Tree-like perennial | Height and drama |
| Creeping Fig | Vine | Over walls, minimal |
| Mahonia Soft Caress | Shrub | "A little bit of Mahonia Soft Caress" |
| Canna Lily (3-4 varieties) | Perennial | "Three or four different varieties of canna lily" |
| Korean Dogwood (Cornus kousa) | Focal tree | Three planted together as multi-trunk; centerpiece |
| Arbutus | Tree | |
| Sage (type of) | Shrub | |
| Bean Carrick | Shrub | |

> "We want this to look jungly and natural and we want these plants to grow like crazy and fill in like crazy because that's how we're going to have the right ambiance appropriate for a zoo exhibit."

### Asian-Influence Residential Garden (Ed's Garden)

| Element | Plants |
|---|---|
| Focal tree | Cork Oaks (2 large); Japanese Maple (red, behind Japanese lantern) |
| Asian accents | Japanese stone lantern; contrasting red maple with green foliage |

> "It's hard not to notice that contrast with the green and the lantern there. It's really picture perfect."

### Restaurant Tropical Patio (Saison Restaurant)

| Layer | Plant | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Canopy** | Mature Olive Trees (transplanted, pruned for visibility) | "The rustic trunks of the olive trees really form the theme." |
| **Tall Focal** | Lady Palm | Centerpiece of patio planting; "we shine the leaves with beer" |
| **Tall Accent** | Banana | Staked for orientation; dramatic height |
| **Mid** | Ginger Lily (5 gallon) | "Three 5-gallon ginger lilies that'll fill in around the bottom part." |
| **Mid/Low** | Salvia, Liriope | "A combination of leaf color and things like salvia, liriope" |
| **Edge/Border** | Dianella + Russelia St. Elmo's Fire | "Really just two plants -- dianella and russelia St. Elmo's Fire" along patio edge |
| **Understory** | Ginger Lily (understory replacements) | "Replacing those understory plants with something a little taller" |

> "When doing plant combinations, as I've said in other videos, we don't want it to give you a headache. So we want some continuity in the planting. We're trying to come up with a plant pallet that doesn't have 30 plants in it. In these small spaces, we want to stick to a pallet that's relatively consistent and simple so that it's pleasing and it's not a mess."

## Entry & Walkway Plantings

### Front Walkway to Door (Eileen's Xeriscape Garden)

A 15+ year garden converted from fescue lawn to a water-efficient front landscape.

| Zone | Plants | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Street edge** | Ginkgo trees (replaced Modesto Ash) | Shade canopy; fall color |
| **Walk border (shade side)** | White Razzleberry + Sea Lavender + Lavandula | Low, wispy; "kind of wispy, gets a little taller than everything else" |
| **Walk border (sun side)** | Russelia St. Elmo's Fire | Coral-red cascading blooms |
| **Ground cover** | Kopia (Coprosma) -- lawn substitute | "Takes traffic like a lawn. You can mow it if you want." |
| **Focal tree** | Flamethrower Redbud (Cercis) | "Not only blooms, but then has these colorful leaves." |
| **Under focal tree** | Dwarf Thyme + Oxalis | "A nice little yellow color there to the bluish purple bloom of the creeping thyme." |
| **Front door approach** | Japanese Maple (green, multi-trunk, 15-20 yr) | Walk under it approaching front door |
| **Front door area** | Marmalade Sky Floribunda Roses + Iceberg Roses + Boxwood around fountain | Color contrast: orange vs. white |
| **Sitting area** | Standard Privet (Ligustrum) as shade trees | "Very nice shady spot to sit" |
| **Front door flanking** | Raphiolepis Majestic Beauty (small evergreen flowering tree) | No root problems; fits tight spaces |
| **Front pots** | Dwarf Mandarin Oranges + Succulents | At front door |
| **Rose border** | Ice Cap roses | "Stays about 3 ft tall. Doesn't get much taller than that." |

> "Really a nice garden that's functional, easy to care for, and creative. We've got a front courtyard. We've got walks that lead you through it in all different directions and beautiful spring color with the roses, the cercis, the St. Elmo's Fire and the Sea Lavender."

### Entry Framing

> "We really like framing your front door. And in this case, they did it beautifully with two trees. Entryways are really important in landscaping because spaces and segments are an integral part of interesting landscapes, and you always need a good entry for spaces and segments."

---

## Foundation Planting Alternatives

John is a vocal critic of traditional foundation planting and consistently advocates for moving plant interest away from the house.

> "Many, many landscapes that you see have plants that are usually too big for their spot right up next to the house, and that is called foundation planting. It started because foundations used to be ugly. Look at your house. Is your house ugly? Do you need to cover it up? We don't need to cover the house."

> "Let's do away with foundation planting. Let's focus on creative spaces in our garden and plants farther out away from the house."

> "We're always trying to bring the plants out into the garden rather than have this row of plants up against the house that's the tallest biggest thing."

### What to Use Instead (from the "100-Year-Old House" Project)

| Position | Plant | Why It Works |
|---|---|---|
| In front of house facade | Ice Cap Roses (not in a straight line) | 2-3 ft tall; won't cover windows; screens infrastructure |
| By chimney | Russelia St. Elmo's Fire (3 plants) | "Lacy but somewhat upright, that'll get 3 to 4 ft tall" |
| Screen for valves/hose | Dianella Casa Blue | Won't get big; screens utilities |
| Under crape myrtle | Nandina Flirt (nine 1-gallon) | "Does not get big, you won't have to prune it, and it's got a real neat form." |
| Along house edges | Liriope (variegated) | Stays small; takes sun or shade |

### House-Appropriate "Won't Swallow Your House" Plants

| Plant | Size | Key Trait |
|---|---|---|
| Camellia Sasanqua Setsugekka | Upright, finely textured | "A nice plant for up against the house" |
| Nandina Flirt | 3-4 ft | Spreading, pendulous; great spring/fall color |
| Tuscan Blue Rosemary | 4 ft tall, 3 ft wide | "Easy to grow, tough, water efficient, and great for cooking." |
| Dwarf Japanese Maple | 3-5 ft | Delicate; won't cover architecture |
| Dianella Casa Blue | 2 ft | "Takes sun and shade, easy to grow, does not require pruning." |
| Ice Cap Rose (dwarf Iceberg) | 3 ft | Repeat bloomer; "doesn't get real big" |
| Low-growing Bougainvillea + Yucca filamentosa Color Guard | Low | "All things that are going to stay small, aren't going to need pruning" |

---

## Front Courtyard Combinations

John frequently creates front courtyards in xeriscape conversions -- replacing lawns with usable outdoor rooms.

> "In our work, we come up with front courtyards all the time that people can use beyond what they ever anticipated. So they can wait for a ride or talk to their neighbors. Get some use out of a front courtyard rather than having broad expansive lawn that you never use."

### Courtyard Plant Palette (South-Facing Xeriscape Conversion)

The courtyard gets its own special palette, lusher than the surrounding drought-tolerant garden.

> "An idea that I like -- even in xeriscape gardens, in the entries and in close-up areas, you can have plants that require more water and/or lusher. So the idea of the courtyard is it will have things like Japanese Maples and Eastern Redbud, Lamb's Ear and variegated liriope and special dwarf Nandina, the smoke bush which is the dwarf smoke bush."

| Courtyard Plant | Role |
|---|---|
| Japanese Maples | Focal trees; color |
| Eastern Redbud | Small flowering tree |
| Lamb's Ear | Soft, silvery foreground texture |
| Variegated Liriope | Border / ground layer |
| Dwarf Nandina | Low structural accent |
| Dwarf Smoke Bush | Unique foliage color |
| Fountain | Central focal point |

**Surrounding the courtyard** (low-water exterior): Fruitless Olives lining walk, Salvia greggii (Mirage Blue / Purple), Kopia ground cover, Butterfly Bush among cobblestone, Plumbago, Ice Cap Roses.

---

## Rose Garden Companions

### Iceberg Roses with Companions

John uses Iceberg roses (and the dwarf version, Ice Cap) as workhorses throughout his designs. Key companion pairings:

| Rose | Companion | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Iceberg Roses (white, grown as small trees) | Annuals beneath (pansies, snapdragons) | "Under it they have annuals and other things." Changed seasonally. |
| Iceberg Roses (white) | Agapanthus (dark blue) | "Roses and agapanthus do frequently bloom at the same time... going to be white and then agapanthus dark bluish." |
| Iceberg Roses | Behind: Red Horse Chestnut tree (Aesculus x carnea) | Spring blooming tree behind rose border |
| Marmalade Sky Floribunda (orange) | Behind: Iceberg Roses (white) | Color contrast: warm vs cool |
| Ice Cap (dwarf Iceberg) | Kopia ground cover + Sea Lavender + Russelia St. Elmo's Fire | Mixed xeriscape border |
| Transplanted roses | Mixed with Ice Cap Roses + ground cover spreading | "Transplanted roses mixed in with our Ice Cap roses which is a dwarf Iceberg. The ground cover is spreading." |

### Rose + Salvia + Annuals (Estate Garden)

> In the large estate garden tour: "Roses and Salvia... lots of annuals along the walks, in this case mostly pansies, roses and Salvia, hydrangeas getting ready to bloom."

---

## Climbing Rose Wall Palette

John installed 252 feet of climbing roses on a block wall, creating a spectacular color wall.

### The Six Climbing Rose Varieties

| Variety | Color | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Don Juan | Deep red | Classic climber |
| Joseph's Coat | Multi-color (red, orange, yellow) | "Really vivid bright colors" |
| Pretty in Pink | Pink | |
| Golden Opportunity | Yellow/gold | |
| Zephirine Drouhin | Pink (thornless) | Historic; good for hot summers |
| Lavender Crush | Lavender | Had to be ordered from out of state |

> "What they're after is this kind of -- I might call an orgasmic mix of color. Really spectacular. They have low roses in the foreground and then they have these big roses all up against the back. Really vivid bright colors."

**Pattern:** One different variety next to each other six times, then the sequence repeats. Spacing approximately 10 ft apart. "There's quite a variation in climbing rose sizes... we kind of like the idea of them growing together and mixing together."

**Trellis:** 16 ft long, 5 ft tall heavy-gauge welded wire in 4x4 squares, painted "Dragon's Breath" (Benjamin Moore).

---

## Parking Strip & Narrow Space Plantings

### Parking Strip Palette

| Plant | Notes |
|---|---|
| Kopia (Coprosma) under Ginkgo trees | "In the parking strip -- kopia under ginkgos." Low water, stays green. |
| Russelia St. Elmo's Fire | Colorful; low water |
| Sedum 'Autumn Joy' | "Just starting to bloom now and it blooms pretty much right through the summer." |
| Decomposed Granite | "A nice contrasting texture; works well in parking strips." |

### Narrow Patio Edge Planting (Restaurant)

> "Right in the beginning here we did a little narrow planting along the edge of the patio that's just doing fantastic and it's really just two plants -- dianella and russelia St. Elmo's Fire."

| Plant | Size | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Dianella | 1-2 ft | Grass-like; stays narrow |
| Russelia St. Elmo's Fire | 3-5 ft | Coral blooms; doesn't spread too wide |

---

## Restaurant / Patio Tropical Palette

When John wants a tropical effect in Central Valley California, he selects from this palette:

### Tropical-Look Plants for Zone 9

| Plant | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lady Palm | Focal canopy plant | "We shine the leaves with beer -- just straight beer, cleaned all the leaves." |
| Banana | Tall dramatic accent | Needs staking; dramatic fronds |
| Ginger Lily (variegated) | Mid-layer; background | "Variegated ginger lilies as a background plant... a nice contrast in color." |
| Canna Lily (3-4 varieties) | Color accent | Used at zoo exhibit with multiple types |
| Japanese Aralia (Fatsia) | Background; architectural foliage | Green + Spider Web (variegated) forms |
| Xanadu Philodendron | Mid-ground in shade | "Three Xanadu philodendron" grouped |
| Star Jasmine | Ground cover / vine | Cascading over walls |
| Creeping Fig | Wall cover | Minimal use on walls |
| Mahonia Soft Caress | Low accent | Softly textured for Asian feel |

> "We want this to look jungly and natural and we want these plants to grow like crazy and fill in like crazy."

---

## Small Front Yard Palette

### Principles for Small Lots

> "Small lots don't have a lot of room for trees... nothing makes a more high-maintenance landscape than inappropriately sized trees."

> "A useful important garden in my mind is if you want to minimize maintenance, to do it with plants that you can allow to grow to their natural forms and you don't have to be clubbing them into submission in order for them not to swallow up your house."

### Small-Space Appropriate Trees

| Tree | Size | Why John Uses It |
|---|---|---|
| Eastern/Western Redbud | Large shrub / small tree | Non-damaging roots; shades western sun |
| Raphiolepis Majestic Beauty | 10-15 ft | "Either you think of it as a large shrub or a very small tree." No root problems. |
| Dwarf Ginkgo 'Jade Butterfly' | ~10 ft | "Grows very slowly"; distinctive leaf shape |
| Crepe Myrtle (Natchez, multi-trunk) | 15-20 ft | Low root damage; summer bloom |
| Dwarf Citrus (in pots) | Stays small | "Dwarf citrus in pots -- you can see it can last 15 years or more." |

---

| **Rose garden** | Dedicated area |
| **Mixed color** | Roses + Salvia + Hydrangeas + Annuals |

> "Quite a lush beautiful planting in a garden that still has simplicity to it -- doesn't look like a mess because a lot of things were planted in mass."

## Seasonal Interest Strategy

John's approach to year-round interest relies on layering plants with different peak seasons and using healthy soil to maximize bloom duration.

### Seasonal Bloom Calendar (Zone 9, Fresno)

| Season | Peak Performers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Winter/Early Spring** | Iceland Poppies, Pansies, Snapdragons, Redbud bloom, Camellia Sasanqua | "All the annuals that bloom in the winter and the early spring and the fall are looking good now." |
| **Spring** | Japanese Maples (red leaf emergence), Loropetalum, Dogwood, Hydrangeas, Iceberg Roses (1st flush), Agapanthus, Lavender | "Red Japanese maples are just starting to show their red leaves. A lot of plants that are putting on leaves now -- if they have colorful leaves they'll be their most colorful in early spring." |
| **Summer** | Lantana, Crepe Myrtles, Salvia, Russelia St. Elmo's Fire, Hibiscus, Bougainvillea, Roses (repeat), Sedum Autumn Joy | "Russelia St. Elmo's Fire blooms like crazy this time of year... There's not many plants that look their best when it's 105." |
| **Fall** | Chinese Pistache (spectacular fall color), Nandina (red foliage), Ginkgo (yellow), Sedum | "Keith Davey Chinese Pistache... spectacular fall color." |
| **Winter structure** | Olive trunks, Evergreen screens (privet, podocarpus), Rock/cobble hardscape | Off-season the garden relies on evergreen structure and hardscape. |

### Year-Round Color Strategy

> "One idea is to try to figure out ways of having color throughout the year. Or maybe some people want it to be smashing in the spring. Usually, it's hard to do both. You need to determine about when you want your color and then you come up with a color theme."

**John's practical approach:** Use annuals in pots for instant seasonal color; rely on repeating bloomers (Ice Cap roses, lantana, salvia) for extended warm-season color; use foliage plants (nandina, Japanese maples, smoke bush) for color when blooms are not present.

## The "Lazy Landscaper" Low-Pruning Palette

In a video with his friend Eddie, John presented plants specifically chosen for minimal maintenance -- the "lazy landscaper" approach.

### No-Prune Plant List

| Plant | Size | Why It's "Lazy" |
|---|---|---|
| Tuscan Blue Rosemary | 4 ft x 3 ft | Water efficient; no pruning needed if right spot; great for cooking |
| Liriope 'Silvery Sunproof' (variegated) | 1-2 ft | Takes sun and shade; never needs pruning |
| Juniper Procumbens Nana | 6-12 in | Grows along ground; tough; no pruning; very low water |
| Agave Blue Glow | 2 ft | Dwarf; "very handsome foliage"; excellent in pots and foreground |
| Agapanthus 'Queen Anne' | 12 in | Compact; no pruning except frost damage |
| Nandina Flirt | 3-4 ft | "You almost never have to prune. And it only gets 3 to 4 ft tall." |
| Russelia St. Elmo's Fire | 4-6 ft | Barely any water; "blooms like crazy" in 105-degree heat |
| Dianella Casa Blue | 2 ft | "Takes sun and shade, easy to grow, does not require pruning." |
| Dwarf Japanese Maple | 3-5 ft | Only light thinning; keeps size naturally |

> "If you want to be a lazy landscaper like me, then I suggest that you maybe write down some of the things that we talk about in this video... and then you can put together your own landscape and at the same time save time, be lazy."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with a small pallet.** Resist the urge to buy one of everything. Pick 5-8 plants and use them boldly.

2. **Mass for impact.** "Think of the impact if you see five of them altogether."

3. **Healthy soil makes any combination look better.** "Whatever color combination you prefer, the real key is healthy soil."

4. **Match water needs.** Don't combine Mediterranean plants with water-loving plants on the same irrigation zone. "You shouldn't combine them with plants all over your yard."

5. **Let plants achieve natural form.** Choose plants whose mature size fits the spot, then stop pruning.

6. **Lusher near the house, sparer farther out.** "Even in xeriscape gardens, in the entries and in close-up areas, you can have plants that require more water."

7. **Screen the ugly, reveal the beautiful.** Use plants strategically to hide infrastructure while keeping the house and architecture visible.

8. **Color is personal -- but massing is universal.** Any color works if it's deployed with intention and massed for impact.
