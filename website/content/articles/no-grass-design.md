## 1. Philosophy: Why Replace the Lawn with a Garden

The designer is an outspoken advocate for eliminating lawns and replacing them with full garden landscapes. The philosophy is rooted in personal experience -- years of failed attempts at maintaining grass in a Florida backyard that was always "mushy," "mucky," diseased, and overrun by fungus. The core argument:

> "I do not have a lawn. My yard is pretty much a rock path that leads into all of my foliage, all of my garden."

> "A lot of my clients will be like, 'Well, but we should kind of have a yard, right?' Well, in some cases if you have kids then absolutely you need a big area for them to play. But for most of us, a nice little rock garden mixed in with maybe some boulders or some other interest and then adding some layers and some landscaping to it -- a rock path is ideal."

> "In Florida, we call it a yard, we call it grass, but it's more weeds than anything. So I got very tired of looking at that and I was like, you know, I'm out with the yard and I'm putting in a rock path. And I have never looked back."

**The key principles:**

- Grass struggles in filtered light, shaded conditions, and wet Florida soils -- it becomes "mushy," diseased, and needs constant re-sodding.
- A garden-instead-of-lawn approach transforms your yard into a personal resort or botanical garden experience.
- The goal is to walk through your backyard the same way you walk through a resort or botanical garden -- with meandering pathways, layered plantings on both sides, focal points, and seating sections.
- The designer cites Walt Disney visiting McKee Botanical Gardens in Vero Beach before creating Adventureland, noting that those "little sloughs and walkway paths through the garden" inspired the theme park design.

> "I don't want to always have to take a vacation to feel like I'm on vacation."

## 2. The Full Garden Conversion Approach

### Phase-Based Conversion

The designer advocates a phased approach for budget-conscious homeowners:

**Phase 1 -- Remove the Sod:**
- Strip out all existing grass/sod.
- This is the essential first step. A landscape company can help with the heavy lifting of sod removal and soil delivery.

**Phase 2 -- Install Edging and Gravel Pathway:**
- Lay edging on both sides to define the walkway.
- Fill the pathway with Tahitian gray granite (the budget-friendly interim walkway).
- Install weed barrier fabric underneath the gravel.

**Phase 3 -- Upgrade to Flagstone (when budget allows):**
- Set flagstone pieces into the gravel base for a more permanent walking surface.
- Add boulders, bird baths, or other interest points at pathway curves.

**Phase 4 -- Plant the Garden Beds:**
- Layer tropical plantings on both sides of the walkway.
- Allow plants to encroach naturally toward the path edges.
- Add focal features (water features, specimen palms, statuary) visible from main seating sections.

> "If you guys are in a situation where I was years ago and you're starting off, consider doing a nice gravel pathway, letting your landscaping encroach right into that space, and then just having to not worry about any kind of fuss."

### His Own Backyard Conversion

> "I have struggled and struggled and you guys know that I am not a sod fan. For whatever reason I can grow plants and trees but not grass. So we did finally remove the sod -- I know, shocker for many of you guys -- but we did finally remove the grass in the entire backyard space. So I chose Tahitian gray granite as our base."

> "I have been to so many resorts, so many botanical gardens, and I have always loved the idea of having a garden on both sides of a walkway and kind of walking through your yard just like you would walk through a resort or a botanical garden."

## 3. Walkway Materials and Design

### Gravel Pathways

**Preferred gravel: Tahitian Gray Granite**

The designer's top choice across virtually all projects. Key characteristics:

- Available in multiple sizes: half-inch, 3/4-inch, inch to inch-and-a-half.
- **Jagged edges** (not round) -- this is critical. The irregular shapes interlock and "knit together" so the gravel does not roll or shift underfoot.
- Compacts naturally after a few rains into a solid, stable walking surface.
- Easy to walk on even in flip-flops or bare feet (especially the half-inch size).
- Handles heavy rain runoff without washing away.
- Complements the gray/natural tones of Florida tropical gardens.

> "Use any kind of stone that has jagged pieces that have multiple different sizes in them. You can go from the half inch to inch and a half. That's my favorite combination, because that half inch gives you all those little pieces that fit in between the inch and an inch and a half pieces. It's a nice solid sturdy base. It's not going anywhere."

> "Where if you have a round stone that has similar sizes, they roll all over the place. I mean, you're kind of just skating on them. Those are perfect for landscape beds, but not for walkways."

**Other gravel/stone types used:**

| Stone Type | Best Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tahitian Gray Granite (1/2" to 1.5") | Walkways, pathways, main ground cover | Top choice -- knits, compacts, does not roll |
| Regular Gray Granite (1/2") | Walkways | Budget alternative when Tahitian is out of stock |
| Alabama White River Rock (1.5") | Decorative beds, contrast areas | Round -- NOT for walkways; beautiful against dark mulch |
| Brown River Rock | Decorative landscape beds | Round -- decorative only |
| White River Rock | Accent areas, decorative contrast | Used with Tahitian gray granite for visual interest |
| Crushed Concrete / PA Millings | Flagstone base leveling | Hardens after rain; cheaper than sand |

**Coverage estimate:** Approximately 100 square feet per yard of gravel or stone.

### Flagstone Pathways

The designer considers flagstone the premium upgrade over bare gravel. Detailed walkthrough of his own backyard project:

**Materials needed:**
- One pallet of flagstone (approximately $600 for buff/tan color; gray stone is ~$100 more per pallet)
- Multiple sizes of flagstone pieces (large for sure footing, small for fill)
- Leveling material: crushed concrete millings (preferred over sand -- $48 per half yard) or setting sand
- Rubber mallet / rubber hammer
- Wheelbarrow
- Tamper
- Edging (aluminum alloy or Buta)
- Weed barrier fabric

**Design approach:**
- Use a garden hose or extension cord to outline the pathway shape first.
- Avoid straight pathways -- create curves and meandering paths with purpose (each curve should reveal something: a boulder grouping, a bird bath, a planting pocket).
- Start and end with wide openings -- "almost like a grand entrance to a space."
- Walk the path before finalizing -- "I want to be able to walk through this pathway in high heels if I have to."

**Installation steps:**
1. Dry-set the flagstone pieces like a puzzle -- lay them out, step back, check the pattern.
2. Walk up and down the path multiple times checking for sure footing and stutter-steps.
3. Level each piece using crushed concrete millings underneath (different thicknesses require different amounts of base material).
4. Set each piece with a rubber mallet, wedging it in tight.
5. Backfill joints with gravel/rock.
6. After 7-8 rains, the millings harden around the stone, creating a stable but natural surface.

> "I like a loose fitting flag stone. It doesn't need to be fully pieced together. I like it where it's set in gravel."

### Stepping Stones

Used as intermediate walkway features:
- Inset into gray granite gravel for a natural look.
- Used in projects where flagstone pathways connect to patios, pool screens, or hot tubs.
- Can be combined with turf between stones for a different aesthetic.

### Pavers

Referenced primarily near pools, patios, and formal areas:
- Used where a polished, formal look is needed near seating sections.
- Plants like Liriope are placed along paver edges to soften the hardscape line with a "dark green defined line."
- Bromeliads (Johannis variety) recommended near pavers because they can handle the "bounceback heat from the pavers."

## 4. Designing Paths Through Garden Beds

### Path Placement Philosophy

> "A lot of times people will want a walkway like right along the house and then do a big heavy planting. And that's perfectly fine, especially if you don't have a lot of room. If you've got less than 9 ft, that's the way to do it. Do a 2-and-a-half-foot walkway along the side of the house and then do your layered landscaping. But if you've got room, if you got about 20 foot to work with, that leaves you room on both sides and maybe doing a two or three foot wide walkway. It changes the whole feel of the space."

**Key design rules:**

1. **Center the path when possible** -- gardens on both sides creates the botanical garden / secret garden feel.
2. **Curve the path with purpose** -- every curve should have a reason: a boulder grouping, a focal planting, a bird bath, a water feature pocket.
3. **Create "pathways off of pathways"** -- branch paths that lead to features like hot tubs, water features, or seating areas.
4. **Block sightlines intentionally** -- use mid-height plants, fronds, or large leaves to interrupt your vision along the path so you are drawn to walk further and discover what is around the bend.
5. **If no grass, no mower clearance needed** -- "They don't have any grass, so we don't have to leave room for a mower to get through." This allows paths and plantings to be tighter and more immersive.
6. **When grass remains nearby, leave 4 feet for mower access** -- "You need about four feet in order to get in here and mow."

### Canopy Over Pathways

> "Anytime you have growth on both sides, if you can kind of have it just canopy over top of you... that really gives you that feel of like being on vacation. There's nothing better than to look above you and just see a crowning, a connection of leaves and fronds."

The designer recommends planting trees and palms that will lean toward each other and create an arbor-like effect over the walking path. This is inspired by botanical garden walkways and resort-style tropical designs.

### Pathway Width Guidelines

| Available Space | Recommended Design |
|---|---|
| Less than 9 ft total | 2.5 ft walkway along house wall + layered planting on one side |
| 12-15 ft total | 2-3 ft centered walkway + gardens on both sides |
| 20+ ft total | 3+ ft walkway with generous planting beds on both sides |

---

## 5. Edging Materials

The designer uses multiple types of edging for different purposes, and considers edging one of the essential structural elements of any no-grass design.

### Aluminum Alloy Edging

**Best for:**
- Separating different stone types from each other (e.g., gray granite from white river rock)
- Separating stone from mulch
- Defining walkway borders
- Flagstone pathway borders

**Characteristics:**
- Clean, crisp, defined line
- Thin profile that nearly disappears once stone and mulch are pushed against it
- Not recommended where lawn mowers will run over it -- too delicate for mower traffic

> "I love the aluminum alloy edging. When you put this stone in, you tamp it down. You make it a nice solid space."

> "I love the aluminum alloy edging for dividing stones or dividing stone from mulch, but not so much for dividing mulch from grass because you know the mowers come through like the Wild West in a lot of these developments."

### Buta Edging (Beauty Edging)

**Best for:**
- Separating garden beds from grass/lawn areas where mowers operate
- Heavy-duty applications
- Sloped areas where soil retention is needed
- Comes in multiple colors (including charcoal)
- Can be lifted and curved to reshape beds over time

**Characteristics:**
- Extremely tough and durable -- "you can pretty much run a truck over top of it"
- Staked fully into the ground
- Does not need to be dug in deeply -- can be set on top of grass and nailed in
- Can be inset 2 inches for a flush look
- Approximately 4 to 12 inches tall
- Holds mulch from washing away on slopes

> "Buta edging is just tough and durable and it gives us still a nice streamline look."

### Natural Stone Edging

- Tennessee boulders and field stone used as natural borders
- Stones can be inset into the ground for a natural embedded look
- Works well for rustic/organic garden styles
- Provides elevation changes in the garden

### Three Reasons to Use Edging

The designer outlines three specific reasons:

1. **Structural necessity with stone ground cover** -- prevents stone from migrating; keeps heat along the edging rather than radiating into beds.
2. **Mulch bed definition** -- prevents beds from expanding over time and keeps a consistent form/outline.
3. **Aesthetic appeal** -- creates visual contrast between different ground covers and materials; provides that "defined, clean line."

---

## 6. Mulch Types and Application

### Usage Philosophy

The designer's ultimate goal is to **eliminate the need for mulch** by using full-coverage plantings:

> "If you notice in my designs, that's exactly what I like to do with all my plants where mulch is kind of only seen along the edges or along the rear side of the bed."

> "I don't want to see mulch at the bottom. I don't want to remulch. I never remulch this area. My ground cover now is the ground forest, the ground floor is all planting."

### When Mulch Is Used

- During establishment of new garden beds before plants grow together
- Along outer edges and rear of beds where plants have not yet connected
- As winter protection -- "It's going to protect your plants. It's going to protect that root system. It's also going to help kind of keep things hydrated."
- In areas between hardscape zones where stone is not appropriate

### Mulch Types Referenced

- **Hardwood mulch** -- mentioned as a soil amendment alternative to perlite in some planting applications
- Dark mulch is preferred for contrast with bright plantings and white river rock

### Stone as Mulch Replacement

In areas prone to runoff, slopes, or water collection, the designer uses stone instead of mulch:

> "We chose to go with stone here because there was constant runoff of mulch going into this driveway. So, the rock really did a fantastic job of solving that problem."

---

## 7. Maintaining Walkability Without Grass

### Gravel Path Construction (Layer System)

The recommended construction sequence from bottom to top:

1. **Tamp down and level the existing soil**
2. **Weed barrier fabric** laid flat on the compacted soil
3. **Edging installed** on both sides of the pathway
4. **Gravel/stone fill** -- Tahitian gray granite (preferred) tamped into place
5. **(Optional) Flagstone** set on top using crushed concrete millings as leveling base

For container/pot installations, a similar layering approach is described:
1. Large gravel at the bottom
2. Weed barrier / cheesecloth
3. Smaller gravel
4. Another layer of weed barrier / cheesecloth
5. Soil on top

### Walkability Features

- Tahitian gray granite "knits together" and creates a stable surface after compaction and rain
- Flagstone provides sure footing within gravel paths
- The designer emphasizes comfort: "I can have flip-flops on and it's just so easy to walk on"
- For hot tub and pool areas, flagstone is inset for bare-foot comfort
- Pathway rock handles heavy rain runoff -- "we get tons of runoff rain right here, which is why the grass wouldn't work, and the Tahitian gray granite has stayed put"

## 8. Plant Selection for Full-Coverage Beds

The designer uses dense, layered tropical plantings to create a self-mulching "jungle floor" that eliminates the need for mulch maintenance and creates the no-grass aesthetic:

### Ground Cover / Low Plants (Front of Bed)

| Plant | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Liriope (Liriope/Laria) | Walkway edge softener, ground cover | Grows over edging to blur hard lines; drought tolerant |
| Burle Marx Philodendron | Jungle floor bedding plant | Cascading, glossy leaves; clusters together; stays 2.5-3 ft; shade tolerant |
| Blue My Mind (Evolvulus) | Low front-of-bed color | Drought tolerant; pairs well with Crotons and Bougainvillea |
| Carissa Boxwood | Compact hedge/border | Stair-step layering between ground cover and taller plants |
| Mexican Heather | Ground cover alternative | Works well as filler |
| Golden Sedum | Shallow ground cover | Can survive on just inches of soil; good for problem areas over concrete |
| Foxtail Fern | Rock garden accent | Drought tolerant; stunning paired with boulders and stone |

### Mid-Level Plants (Color and Texture)

| Plant | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Crotons (multiple varieties: Ice Tone, Excellence, Ruby Red) | Color and contrast | Ice Tone for shade; Ruby Red for burgundy tones; Excellence for bold color |
| Song of India (Dracaena reflexa) | Bright variegated accent | Sandwiched between dark plantings for contrast |
| Aglaonema (Silver Falls, Diamond Frost) | Shade brighteners | Pest-free; minimal trimming; hurricane-tough |
| Dieffenbachia Camouflage | Bright foliage in dark spots | Hurricane-resistant; tolerates wet feet |
| Helen Johnson Bougainvillea (dwarf) | Low color accent | Dwarf variety stays compact; dark pink/violet flowers |
| Ixora | Color beds | Heat tolerant; good near pavers |
| Bromeliads (Johannis, Neoregelia, Imperialis) | Accent groupings | Handle paver heat bounce; bold tropical statement |
| Giant Apostle Iris | Versatile filler | Grows in water or drought; shallow roots |

### Tall / Background Plants

| Plant | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Clusia (Clusia guttifera / rosea) | Privacy hedge wall | Can reach 6-10 ft; creates "green wall" when no mower access needed |
| Rojo Red Jacob's Coat (Acalypha) | Bright red screen | Plants connect in triangle formation; reaches 5-6 ft |
| Red Cone Ginger | Tall tropical accent | Reaches 6 ft; dramatic cone-shaped blooms; cut to base after cold |
| Eureka Palm | Fast vertical coverage | Needs trimming every 3 months; gives coverage from house sides |
| Triangle Fan Palm | Specimen backdrop | Silvery-green fronds; turns toward sun |
| Bottle Palm | Specimen focal point | Slow-growing conversation piece |
| Foxtail Palm | Privacy and canopy | Grows quickly; great for creating overhead canopy effect |

### The "Self-Mulching" Principle

> "Once these connect, you're not mulching in this bed. You're only mulching along the tips or along the edges of the garden. This is all concealed."

The designer's approach is to plant densely enough that the ground cover plants form a continuous living carpet, eliminating visible soil and the need for mulch replenishment. Plants like Liriope, Burle Marx Philodendron, and Bromeliads serve this role.

## 9. Water Savings and Maintenance Comparison vs. Lawn

### Cost Savings from Eliminating Grass

> "How it saves you money is the fact that you're not mowing, you're not edging, you're not fertilizing, you're not treating it constantly like I was treating mine for fungus and for whatnot, trying to keep it healthy."

> "I wish I would have done that from the very beginning instead of wasting thousands on re-sodding year after year several several times."

**Lawn costs eliminated:**
- Weekly mowing service
- Edging and trimming
- Fertilizer applications
- Fungicide and pest treatments
- Re-sodding (the designer re-sodded "countless times")
- Irrigation for turf maintenance

**Garden/gravel costs:**
- Initial material investment (gravel, edging, flagstone, plants)
- One-time installation labor
- Minimal ongoing maintenance (occasional plant trimming)

> "The initial cost is there, absolutely. But now it's done and I don't have to worry about maintaining this area. It's always clean, it's always crisp, and it always highlights the landscaping."

### Irrigation Reduction

- Established tropical gardens in Florida rely heavily on natural rainfall
- Many recommended plants are drought tolerant (Foxtail Ferns, Bougainvillea, Desert Rose, Blue My Mind, Liriope)
- The designer specifically selects plants that thrive on "water saver" principles
- Once plantings are established, a dense canopy reduces soil moisture loss

### Maintenance Comparison

| Task | Lawn | No-Grass Garden |
|---|---|---|
| Mowing | Weekly | Eliminated |
| Edging grass | Weekly | Eliminated |
| Fertilizing turf | Multiple times/year | Eliminated |
| Fungicide/pest treatment | Ongoing | Eliminated |
| Re-sodding | Periodically (expensive) | Never |
| Mulch replenishment | N/A | Minimal once plants fill in |
| Plant trimming | N/A | Quarterly (hedge trims by maintenance crew) |
| Weed control | Ongoing | Reduced (weed barrier + dense planting) |

## 10. Specific No-Grass Project Walkthroughs

### Project 1: Designer's Own Backyard (Multiple Videos)

**Situation:** Suburban home in Vero Beach; standard backyard with failed grass that was always mucky, diseased, and needed constant re-sodding due to filtered light and heavy rain.

**What was done:**
- Removed all sod from the entire backyard space
- Installed Tahitian gray granite as the base walkway/pathway material
- Created a meandering central walkway with gardens on both sides
- Used Buta edging to define beds on one side, aluminum alloy on the other
- Installed a water feature (waterfall) as the central focal point, visible from all seating sections
- Planted layered tropical gardens: palms (Triangle Fan, Bottle, Foxtail, Spindle), Crotons, Bromeliads, Aglaonemas, Philodendrons, Gingers
- Added flagstone walkway through drainage easement
- Created a bird feeding zone on the rock path (no grass means no weed seeds from bird feed)
- Incorporated boulders, statuary, and bistro lighting

> "I have a true walkway where we created a different type of planting on the other side."

**Future phases planned:** Flagstone through main path, hot tub area with flagstone approach, additional boulder groupings.

### Project 2: Client Backyard -- Tropical Garden with Gravel Walkway

**Situation:** Client wanted a no-grass backyard -- "a tropical garden with a little walkway and just kind of enjoying the whole space without any maintenance of grass back here."

**What was done:**
- Removed old sod that "would not just live" under existing trees
- Installed gray granite stone (half-inch, smallest variety) as the walkway
- Created garden beds on both sides of the central pathway
- Planted: Pink Hibiscus backdrop, multicolored Bougainvillea tree, Helen Johnson Bougainvillea (dwarf), Blue My Mind, Carissa Boxwood, Song of India, Burle Marx Philodendron, Liriope along walkway edges, Spindle Palm
- Aluminum alloy edging along the walkway
- Soft organic feel -- "We didn't want anything too polished because this is a soft tropical planting"
- Pool/seating area kept polished; the garden walkway was intentionally casual

### Project 3: Sharon's Sideyard Garden Conversion

**Situation:** Pool consumed the entire backyard; sideyard was nothing but grass. Client wanted a private garden retreat.

**What was done:**
- Removed all grass from the sideyard
- Brought in Tahitian gray granite as base
- Inset flagstone all the way from the gate to the pool screen
- Planted gardens on either side of the flagstone walkway
- Added a water feature
- Created a seating/relaxation area

> "We took up all the grass, we brought in some Tahitian gray granite, some beautiful flagstone, inset the flagstone all the way from the gate to the pool screen, and then did gardens on either side of it."

### Project 4: Client Property with Drainage Challenges

**Situation:** Property with significant underground concrete/drainage issues limiting planting depth; wide space needing a creative solution.

**What was done:**
- Created a curved crushed granite U-path lined with aluminum alloy edging
- Widened the path as much as possible without looking excessive
- Created curves to form garden pockets on both sides of the walkway
- Planted shallow-rooted and wet-feet plants in problem areas (Golden Sedum, Giant Apostle Iris)
- Used Blue My Mind in corners against gray granite for color pop

### Project 5: Screen Room Patio Buffer Project

**Situation:** Mowers were throwing dust and debris onto screen room; grass right up to the patio was causing constant screen maintenance.

**What was done:**
- Removed grass adjacent to the patio/screen room
- Installed gray granite pathway starting right from the patio edge
- Inset stepping stones into the granite
- Used aluminum alloy edging to separate gray granite, mulch, and Alabama white river rock zones
- Created a pathway off of the main pathway leading to a focal water feature
- Buta edging used to separate mulch from grass in areas where mowers still operated

> "Anytime you can do stone or even if it's a clean mulch bed right up against the patio, that just prevents the mowers from getting anywhere near this area throwing dust all over these screens."

---

## 11. Patio Integration

### Connecting Patios to Garden Spaces

- Stone pathways should start "right from the patio itself" -- no gap of grass between the patio and the garden.
- This prevents mower damage to screens and eliminates dust/debris on patio areas.
- The designer's own home has a 12-foot patio running along the house length, then a 9-10 foot garden zone before the walkway begins.
- Boulders used as step-downs from patio level into garden areas.

### Patio as Viewing Platform

> "As soon as I walked out from my back door, I not only wanted to see gardens on either side of my seating sections, I wanted to see right off the bat my water feature that is inset into the backyard."

> "Whether it's the kitchen window or the back patio doors or the pool area, whatever that might be -- having two anchored areas [of planting] is key."

### Pool Patio Integration

- Stone/mulch beds buffer the pool cage from mowers and weed eaters
- Stepping stone pathways in Tahitian gray granite connect pool screens to garden walkways
- Flagstone recommended near pools and hot tubs for bare-foot comfort

---

## 12. Seating Areas Within Gardens

### Philosophy

> "Anytime I have a seating section that I spend time in, I do try to stick something in with some fragrance."

The designer treats seating areas as the primary vantage points from which the entire garden design radiates:

- **Focal points** (water features, specimen palms, fountains, pergolas) are placed directly in the line of sight from the main seating section.
- **Fragrant plants** (Gardenia, Variegated Confederate Jasmine) are positioned near seating areas for sensory experience.
- **Privacy planting** surrounds seating areas to create an enclosed, resort-like feel.

### Types of Seating Integration

1. **Back patio / screen room seating** -- Main vantage point; garden designed to be viewed from here; water features centered on this sightline.
2. **Garden bench seating** -- The designer references benches within botanical gardens: "I would have benches everywhere."
3. **Fire pit areas** -- Referenced in the front yard garden behind Clusia privacy walls: "We have had fire pits with family and just kind of enjoy."
4. **Dining / entertaining areas** -- Dinner parties, tented events in garden spaces enclosed by privacy hedging with solar lights.
5. **Coffee / morning spots** -- The walkway and water feature are positioned for enjoyment during morning coffee routines.

### Creating Privacy for Seating

- Clusia hedges (6-10 ft) create living walls around seating spaces
- Solar lights threaded through hedges for evening ambiance
- Layered tropical plantings create "engulfing" corners that simulate a resort environment

> "I feel like I'm engulfed in this whole corner. And that's the part of being in a resort. That's the part of being in a tropical landscape."

---

## 13. Step-by-Step: Creating a No-Grass Backyard (Summary)

Based on the designer's combined advice across multiple videos:

1. **Plan your layout** -- Decide what will be garden, what will be walkway/path, and where seating/features will go. Sketch or use a hose to outline curves.
2. **Remove all sod** -- Have a landscape company help with heavy lifting if needed.
3. **Amend the soil** -- Add good planting soil to bed areas.
4. **Install edging** -- Aluminum alloy for stone-to-stone or stone-to-mulch dividers; Buta edging where mowers may still operate or for heavy-duty retention.
5. **Lay weed barrier** -- Fabric under all walkway areas, tamped down on solid soil.
6. **Install gravel/stone walkway** -- Tahitian gray granite (3/4" to 1.5" for walkways); fill and let rain compact naturally.
7. **Set flagstone (if budget allows)** -- Dry-set on crushed concrete millings; use rubber mallet; walk-test for sure footing.
8. **Plant trees and palms first** -- Place specimen trees and palms as anchors and focal points.
9. **Layer in mid-level plants** -- Crotons, Bromeliads, Gingers, Aglaonemas for color and texture.
10. **Fill in ground cover last** -- Liriope, Burle Marx, Blue My Mind to create the living carpet that replaces mulch.
11. **Add features** -- Water features, boulders, statuary, bird baths at pathway curves and focal points.
12. **Install lighting** -- Bistro lights along perimeter; small path lights along walkways; solar post lights at gate entries; spotlights on specimen plants.
13. **Let it grow in** -- Over 1-2 years, plants connect, ground covers seal the soil, canopies form over pathways, and the garden becomes self-sustaining.

## 14. Key Takeaways

- **Grass is optional.** In Florida's climate, a rock-and-garden approach is often more sustainable, more beautiful, and less expensive long-term than maintaining turf.
- **Tahitian gray granite is the workhorse material** for walkable garden paths -- it knits, compacts, handles rain, and looks natural.
- **Edging is structural, not decorative** -- it holds the entire design together and prevents material migration.
- **Curve everything** -- Straight paths feel institutional; curved paths create discovery, intimacy, and the botanical garden experience.
- **Plant to eliminate mulch** -- Dense, layered, full-coverage planting is the ultimate low-maintenance ground treatment.
- **Design from the seating section outward** -- Every garden should have a focal point visible from where you spend the most time.
- **Phase your investment** -- Start with sod removal and gravel; upgrade to flagstone and specimen plants over months or years.
- **The no-grass yard pays for itself** -- Eliminating mowing, fertilizing, fungicide, and re-sodding costs means the initial garden investment is recovered over time.
