## Core Philosophy

Landscaping is expensive, but unlike buying a house, you get to see it grow over time. The designer repeatedly emphasizes that you do not have to do everything at once. Work in phases, invest wisely in the right places, and let fast growers catch up on their own. The number one money-saving tip is **knowing the direction you are going in before you hit the nursery**, because impulse buying at a nursery "can take you down a crazy path."

> "Landscaping is expensive. It's an investment, and the last thing you want to do is invest in landscaping that you're having to redo later."

## When to Splurge on Larger Specimens (25-Gallon, 30-Gallon, 45-Gallon+)

### Slow Growers -- Buy Big

These plants grow so slowly that buying them small means waiting years for impact. Spend the extra money up front:

- **Bottle Palm** -- "It is one to splurge on because it grows so slow. In eight or nine months it probably hasn't grown 6 inches. Get everything else small plant-wise like the copper leaves because they grow like crazy. Things like this bottle palm, get them with a little bit more size to them so you can really enjoy them pretty quickly."
- **Mammy Crotons** -- "When you have smaller plants or dwarf plants like the mammy crotons, it's a good idea to bring them in at a 7 or 10 gallon size because that's really going to give you that instantaneous layering. They're such a slow grower -- if I brought them in at a smaller size, it's going to take forever. The cost difference isn't huge. Better just to get five and do it first time with big material."
- **Icetone Crotons** -- Brought in at 10-gallon because "they grow so much slower." Paired with 3-gallon Sanchezia that will catch up on their own.
- **Carpoxylon Palm** -- "Big budget for a small tree and it takes a while. I try to give my clients a bigger bang for the buck right off the bat." If you have patience, buy young -- but know it will take years to become a showpiece.
- **Podocarpus (Weeping variety)** -- "They grow slower, they're a much nicer variety. They are a little bit more expensive than the regular podocarpus, but you definitely get paid back for it."
- **Clusia** -- 10-gallon or 15-gallon recommended. "One of the most important things to get in at a good size." Six 15-gallon Clusia were used to create a privacy wall. Also noted: Clusia grows about 3 feet per year, making even small sizes viable if you can wait.
- **Silver Bismarckia Palm** -- "Go ahead and splurge on a silver Bismarckia palm because they're just a cool, cool tree."
- **Yucca Rostrata** -- Brought in at 15-gallon size. "When this guy gets big, they get very, very expensive as they grow taller."
- **Kentopsis Palm** -- Found in 30-gallon, 45-gallon or field-grown. "Don't hesitate to get it because they're usually gorgeous." They take longer to get established, so nurseries take extra time cultivating them.
- **Loquat Palm (Licuala)** -- Brought in at 3-gallon because "they're a bit pricey, these little trees." Slow grower, so even small purchases represent significant investment.
- **Blue Agave (expensive variety)** -- Surprisingly, the designer brings these in SMALL because "it's a little bit more expensive of an agave and it grows much faster -- so to me that doesn't make a lot of sense" to buy big. "When you get these guys they do not need to be big when you get them. They will flush out and be giant in no time."

### Backbone Trees -- Buy Big for Instant Structure

These are your "columns in the garden" that set the scale for everything else:

- **Coconut Palm** -- 30-gallon size, about 14 feet tall. "You get a lot of size with this tree, a lot for the money with this tree."
- **Traveler's Palm** -- 30-gallon recommended as backdrop trees. "About 8 feet tall. You can easily pick these up at 15-gallon size, about 5 feet tall and about half as wide, way easier to maneuver."
- **Fishtail Palm** -- 30-gallon or 45-gallon. "We came in with some 45-gallon fishtail palms" for instant privacy near a house.
- **Foxtail Palm** -- Start with 30-gallon or 15-gallon for the tallest layer. "If you're starting out with 7-gallon material, that's perfectly fine because they're going to get some serious size to it."
- **Powder Puff Trees** -- "I tried to bring them in at 30-gallon size because these powder puffs grow a little bit slower. You get about 2 feet this year at the top."
- **Triangle Fan Palm** -- 25-gallon recommended for the mid-layer. "That's going to be about half the size" of your tallest tree.
- **Pygmy Date Palm** -- 25-gallon. "They come in about 5 to 6 feet tall when they're that size."
- **Pindo Palm** -- "Very young, a 25-gallon palm tree when we put it in."

## When to Save with Smaller Sizes (1-Gallon, 3-Gallon)

### Fast Growers -- Start Small

These plants grow quickly enough that buying small is the smart move:

- **Sanchezia** -- "They're super growers. There's no sense in spending the money and upping the pot size. So, I got those in three gallons. In no time, those will catch up and become a nice 4-foot sea of bright green and yellow."
- **Areca (Eureka) Palms** -- The gold standard for budget-friendly privacy. "You can get them this big -- they do not need to be large when you put them in. You're going to get three to four feet of growth per year. Plant them about 4 to 5 feet apart in a 7-gallon container (about 6 feet tall) and in no time they will connect and create that great wall."
- **Copper Leaf (Acalypha)** -- "Get everything else small plant-wise like the copper leaves because they grow like crazy." Five 7-gallon copper leaves used as a wall planting.
- **Brazilian Red Cloak** -- "If this plant in the nursery cost you $25, do not fret -- this plant will give you 50 plants every time you go to trim it." Some planted at 3-gallon; some at 7-gallon and 15-gallon for instant backdrop.
- **Gold Mound (Golden Dewdrop/Duranta)** -- Fast ground cover, used at 1-gallon or 3-gallon size as the lowest layer.
- **Dwarf Ixora** -- Used as bedding/ground cover at smaller sizes near walkways.
- **Pagoda Plant** -- "These were three gallon when I planted them. Maybe two months and they're absolutely stunning in six months to a year."
- **Agave (standard varieties)** -- Fast-growing types can be brought in smaller.
- **Cat Palms** -- Budget-friendly clumping palms that multiply on their own.

## The Gallon-Size Layering System

The designer's core method for using gallon sizes to create instant depth:

### The Waterfall Effect

> "You always want to start with manipulating your gallon size. If you can start with your big material first, then come in with your layered material."

**Layer breakdown by gallon size:**

| Position | Gallon Size | Role | Example Plants |
|----------|-------------|------|----------------|
| Rear/Backdrop | 30-gallon | "Roof line" trees | Coconut Palm, Traveler's Palm, Fishtail Palm |
| Second tier | 25-gallon | Mid-canopy trees | Triangle Fan Palm, Pindo Palm |
| Third tier | 15-gallon | Intermediate trees/large shrubs | Cat Palm, Sloppy Painter, Brazilian Red Cloak |
| Fourth tier | 7-gallon | Accent shrubs/small palms | Mango Crotons, Dwarf Carissa, Mammy Crotons |
| Fifth tier | 3-gallon | Bedding/filler | Sanchezia, Pagoda, smaller shrubs |
| Ground level | 1-gallon | Ground cover | Gold Mound, Dwarf Ixora, Sedum |

> "Come in with 30-gallon plants in your backdrop. Then 15-gallon, then seven gallon, three gallon, one gallon. That's a great way to make sure you're working in layers."

### Spacing by Gallon Size

- **1-gallon:** 1 to 2 feet on center
- **3-gallon:** Solid 2 feet apart
- **7-gallon:** 2 to 3 feet apart (depending on plant type)
- **Larger sizes:** Plant-specific; zigzag pattern recommended to maximize coverage in small spaces

## Specific Gallon-Size Recommendations by Plant

| Plant | Recommended Size | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Clusia (hedge) | 10-15 gallon | "My favorite size -- by that point they're half grown, 5 feet tall." Even 3-gallon works if budget-tight (grows 3 ft/year). |
| Clusia (privacy wall) | 15-25 gallon | "25-gallon size, my favorite size to get them in." |
| Mammy Crotons | 7-10 gallon | Slow growers; worth the extra cost for instant shape. |
| Sloppy Painter (Pseuderanthemum) | 7-15 gallon | "If you can get them in seven or 15-gallon size, do it. It's well worth the extra money because of the weight on their growth habits." |
| Cat Palms | 15-25 gallon | "I love the 25-gallon size because they've clustered nice and tight. 15-gallon is a little bit thinner and 7/3-gallon takes too long for them to really clump." "Just spend the extra money." |
| Anthurium | 5-15 gallon | "You can bring in a 15-gallon if you like. I like to bring in some nice five gallons and cluster them together into one hole." |
| Dwarf Tree Jasmine | 5-gallon | Three planted together for a corner grouping. |
| Areca Palms | 7-gallon | Budget-friendly at any size; 3-4 feet growth per year. |
| Foxtail Palm | 7-30 gallon | "If you're starting out with 7-gallon material, that's perfectly fine." |
| Bottle Palm | Buy as large as possible | Ultra-slow grower. Splurge here. |
| Banana Leaf Crotons | 15-gallon | "Brought these guys in at 15-gallon size." |
| False Agave | 15-gallon | "A 15-gallon gorgeous false agave." |
| Mule Palm | 7-15 gallon | "You can really work with it in any size." |
| Coconut Palm | 25-30 gallon | "A 25-gallon size, great size to start with if your budget allows. A 65-gallon will get the canopy over the headline of people." |
| Fishtail Palm | 30-45 gallon | For instant privacy/coverage. |
| King Alexander Palm | 7+ gallon | Works at smaller sizes since it gains height. |
| Powder Puff Tree | 25-30 gallon | "30-gallon size because these powder puffs grow a little bit slower." |
| Crotons (dwarfed varieties) | 25-gallon | "Brought them in at 25-gallon size -- they are a nice big size for what is technically a dwarfed croton." |
| Louisiana Red (Ti Plant) | 7-gallon | Four 7-gallon plants created great coverage after 2 years. |
| Brazilian Red Cloak | 7-15 gallon (or propagate) | 15-gallon for backdrop; 3-gallon acceptable but grows fast enough to catch up. "I probably will not plant them that small again." |

## Cost-Saving Tips and Tricks

### 1. Propagation -- Your Best Money-Saving Tool

The designer calls this the number one budget strategy:

- **Brazilian Red Cloak** -- "If this plant in the nursery cost you $25, do not fret. This plant will give you 50 plants every time you go to trim it." Cut between the nodes, cut leaves in half to redirect energy to roots, stick directly in the ground. Roots establish in 5-6 weeks.
- **Dwarf Alocasia** -- "I keep taking pieces from him and he doesn't mind. She always produces these pups for me." Put pups in water or ground; roots within 3 weeks.
- **Ficus Triangularis (Heart Ficus)** -- "I love how easy it is to propagate. If this plant cost you $28, do not fret -- reuse, free plants, do the math."
- **Cordylines (Ti Plants/Quarter Lines)** -- Easy to propagate from cuttings. "Very, very easy to do."
- **Sanchezia** -- Easy to propagate and very fast growing.
- **Philodendrons** -- A subscriber "propagates all over -- she was showing me this is from this cluster, that's from that cluster."
- **Lady Palm (Rhapis)** -- "We have split and given to friends, family, whoever wants one."

**General propagation tips:**
- Cut at an angle between the nodes
- Cut large leaves in half to push energy toward root development
- Place cutting directly in ground near an irrigation head, or let dry for a day first
- Water heavily for 3 weeks; roots grab hold in 5-6 weeks
- Use rooting powder if possible (lack of it may cause failure)
- Always use a clean knife (wipe with vinegar and water)

### 2. Split/Divide Clumping Plants

> "Get some clumping plants. Plants that provide pups, plants that provide extra plants for the rest of your garden. If you spend $20 or $25 on one plant, a three-gallon plant grouping -- just do the math. You can take that particular plant and propagate and put it all through the yard."

Best clumping plants to split:
- Dwarf Alocasia
- Agapanthus (Agaves)
- Areca Palms
- Cat Palms
- Rhapis (Lady) Palms
- Bromeliads (produce pups)

### 3. Phase Your Installation

> "Having a master plan really does a great job of taking out the guesswork. If you're doing this on a budget, having the heavy lifting done initially is ideal and then come in with all the fun stuff."

**Phase approach:**
1. **Phase 1 -- Hardscape and backbone trees:** Soil prep, big trees (30-gallon backdrop material), stone/rock paths
2. **Phase 2 -- Mid-layer trees and accent plants:** 15-25 gallon intermediate material
3. **Phase 3 -- Bedding, ground cover, color:** 3-7 gallon accent plants, propagated material
4. **Phase 4 -- Finishing touches:** Lighting, statues, water features, container plantings

> "As they're waiting for budgets to allow for the next phase, they're going to have some fullness down below."

### 4. Eliminate Grass/Lawn

> "A rock path is ideal and how it saves you money is the fact that you're not mowing, you're not edging, you're not fertilizing, you're not treating it constantly. The initial cost is there absolutely, but now it's done and I don't have to worry about maintaining this area."

Rock vs. mulch:
- Rock is about 5 times more expensive than mulch up front
- Rock is permanent -- no re-mulching every year
- Use weed barrier underneath rock
- Areas near front door: rock is better than mulch (mulch dyes can stain, attracts pests near entry)

### 5. Smart Shopping Strategy

> "Not all of your plants need to be showstoppers. Get your tried and true tough plants -- your Gold Mound, your Mammy Croton, your Dwarf Ixora. Then the things that need a little bit more love, get three of the Mango Croton just to dial into the perfect spot. Then get your lesser expensive material as your mass planting and you're going to get a lot for the money that way."

**The formula:** Splurge on 2-3 focal-point plants, then use inexpensive mass-planting material (Gold Mound, Dwarf Ixora) to fill in around them.

### 6. Buy the Bigger Size on Slow Growers, Save on Fast Growers

> "Splurge on [slow growers] because they grow so slow. Get everything else small plant-wise like the copper leaves because they grow like crazy."

### 7. Fertilizer Savings

- Use granular 8-2-12 palm fertilizer (chicken-feed method around plants) -- about $6/bag
- Supplement with Black Cow (50%), Pete Moss (25%), Pine Bark Nuggets (25%) soil mix
- Much cheaper than Miracle-Gro ($17/bag for organics vs. $6/bag for 8-2-12)
- Gypsum for clay soil modification -- "cheapest and easiest and quickest way" to fix heavy soil

## Where to Source Plants

### Local Nurseries (Preferred)

The designer strongly prefers local nurseries for selection and quality:

- **Seven's Nursery** -- Sebastian, Florida. Smaller nursery, charming, open to public. Good selection of tropical material.
- **Perfect Palm** -- Vero Beach area. Huge palm nursery with thousands of foxtails, queens, and specialty species.
- **Groveland area nurseries** -- Larger wholesale nurseries, some open to public by appointment. Good for bulk purchases with a master plan in hand.
- **PlantSearch tip:** "Log in, put in your zip code, put in the plant of choice, and find out what nursery nearby might have it."
- **Nursery shopping advice:** "Pick the prettiest plant in a batch. When you see a bigger tree at the nursery than the rest of the trees in that grouping, you know that plant or tree has more than likely been there longer" (may be rootbound -- check before buying).

### Big Box Stores

- **Home Depot and Lowe's** -- Good for common material at smaller sizes. "You can get those from Lowe's and Home Depot and find them just about anywhere. Get them started." Specifically mentioned for:
  - 3-gallon and 7-gallon Clusia
  - 3-gallon shrubs and ground covers
  - Small palms for starting out
  - However, beware of small-stemmed clumping bamboo palms ("the little three-gallon ones you find at Home Depot or Lowe's -- the ones with the small stems, those can be scary in the garden")

### Facebook Marketplace

> "Facebook Marketplace is my ideal way to go. I'm constantly telling clients to look at Facebook Marketplace."

Best finds on Marketplace:
- Statues and garden art ("teeny tiny percent of what it would be brand new")
- Water features and fountains ("If you want a fountain and you want it on a budget, go to Facebook Marketplace")
- Unique pots and containers
- Drive 30-40 miles if needed for the right piece

### Garage Sales and Thrift Stores

- Containers and vases for $1-$2 that work perfectly for small plants and indoor displays
- "So many cute ones that I found that you can put little plants in there"

### Amazon Storefront

The designer maintains an Amazon storefront for:
- Gardening tools
- Solar lights and landscape lighting
- Specific recommended products
- Not for plants themselves

### Clearance Sections

"I actually picked these up on clearance because I wanted to see how they performed." Clearance plants from nurseries can be rehabilitated.

## DIY vs. Hiring a Professional

### The Hybrid Approach (Most Recommended)

> "Maybe having a landscape company create a plan for you that you can develop over time. Or if the budget allows, have them come in and put in the bigger features, the accents, and the tough things to get into your backyard, or have them do some of the heavy lifting of removing that sod and bringing in that soil -- and then leaving you that next area to really bring in your personality."

**What to hire out:**
- Master plan / design rendering (a roadmap you can hand to any contractor or use yourself)
- Soil preparation and amendment
- Large tree installation (30-gallon+ material)
- Irrigation installation and drainage work
- Hardscape (pavers, flagstone, retaining walls)
- Heavy lifting: sod removal, major grading

**What DIYers can handle:**
- 7-gallon and smaller plant installation
- Propagation and filling in gaps over time
- Ground cover planting (1-3 gallon material)
- Mulching and rock installation
- Adding container plants, statues, and garden art
- Bistro/solar lighting installation
- Routine trimming and maintenance
- Fertilizing (granular application)

### Full Professional Installation

> "A lot of our clients will call us and we'll come in and do the whole thing from start to finish and that's an ideal way to do it."

**When to go full professional:**
- Complex pool-area landscapes
- Tight spaces requiring precise layering
- Projects requiring equipment (loaders, large tree handling)
- When an HOA requires professional landscaping

### What to Look for in a Contractor

- Make sure they actually tag your material at the nursery (they should be picking the prettiest plant in the batch)
- Ask to see them choose plant material
- Pay attention to growth rate tags at the nursery -- "Listen to your nursery people when they tell you that this plant is going to get this size."
- Get a care schedule with the installation

### DIY Weekend Warrior Strategy

> "If you don't have a landscape crew, if you don't have a loader, you're going to have your two sons or some friends do a weekend planting for some pizza and beer -- then pick start with whatever your fundamental trees are."

- Start with what fits in the back of your SUV (7-gallon material)
- Focus on backbone trees first
- Let growth dictate your next moves
- "Start young if you have the time and you just don't have the budget. Start with some container size -- three gallon, seven gallon, 15 gallon, 25 gallon."

---

## Container/Pot Growing Tips

### Benefits of Pot Growing

- **Controls aggressive growers:** "Being able to contain them in a pot slows the growth way down. You can really keep these in nice little tree forms for years and years."
- **Extends life of tropical plants:** "I've had one in a pot for five years, which is kind of unheard of for potted plants. Usually you have a 2-year turnaround for anything to be super healthy."
- **Portability:** Move plants to protect from cold or sun damage
- **Space management:** Ideal for narrow spaces where in-ground planting would be overwhelming

### Top 5 Potted Plant Recommendations

The designer specifically highlights five favorite potted plants for Florida:
1. Potted tropicals for shade areas
2. Desert Rose
3. Shade-tolerant palms in containers
4. Plants that are aggressive in-ground but manageable in pots
5. Accent plants on pedestals (great for dwarf trees at 3-gallon size -- "put it on a pedestal so that way you can kind of see it")

### Container Strategy for Budget

- Start plants in containers before committing to ground planting
- Use 3-gallon and 7-gallon sizes to test placement before buying larger
- Place potted plants strategically while waiting for in-ground plants to mature

## Price Points and Budget Ranges Mentioned

| Item | Price Mentioned |
|------|----------------|
| 3-gallon tropical plant | $20-$25 |
| Ficus Triangularis | ~$28 per plant |
| Flagstone pathway (half-yard cement millings) | $48 |
| Flagstone (greystone variety) | ~$100 more per pallet than standard |
| Bistro/solar lights | ~$50-$60 per strand |
| Spotlight solar accent | ~$15 per unit |
| 8-2-12 Palm Fertilizer | ~$6 per bag |
| Miracle-Gro Organics | ~$17 per bag |
| Pavers (traditional size) | ~$4 per foot |
| Online gardening community membership | $25/individual, $5 more for a couple |
| General rule: "Put a $5 tree into a $20 hole" | Soil prep investment should be 4x the tree cost |

---

## The "Put a $5 Tree into a $20 Hole" Rule

> "Put a $5 tree into a $20 hole and you will have success. I know it sounds like expensive landscaping, but that is the ratio. Put a smaller tree in, but definitely work the soil."

This means investing heavily in soil preparation:
- 50% Black Cow
- 25% Peat Moss
- 25% Pine Bark Nuggets
- Add premium soil even if it costs more -- "do not be afraid even if it costs more to add in some premium soil into your garden because that also makes a huge difference"

---

## Summary: The Budget Decision Tree

1. **Is it a slow grower?** Buy bigger (15-25+ gallon). You will wait years otherwise.
2. **Is it a fast grower?** Buy small (3-gallon). Save the money -- it will catch up.
3. **Is it your backbone/backdrop tree?** Buy as large as you can handle (25-30 gallon). This sets the scale.
4. **Is it mass planting/ground cover?** Buy smallest (1-3 gallon). You need volume, not size.
5. **Can you propagate it?** Buy one nice specimen and multiply it throughout your garden for free.
6. **Are you phasing the project?** Start with structure (big trees + hardscape), fill in with small/propagated material over time.
7. **Focus your budget:** Splurge on the areas where you sit and relax. "Make sure that I'm using the budget wisely. You guys want to make sure that if you're investing in these trees and these plants that gosh, you're getting the best view from the areas that matter."
