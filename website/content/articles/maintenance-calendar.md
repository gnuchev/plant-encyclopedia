## 1. Monthly / Seasonal Calendar Overview

### JANUARY
- **Freeze Preparation** (if freeze forecast):
  - Water heavily the day before and morning of the freeze (45 minutes to 1 hour of saturation, vs. normal 15-20 minutes).
  - Stop watering the evening of the freeze -- no water left on leaves overnight.
  - Wrap sensitive palms and tropicals with old-style **incandescent Christmas lights** (they emit heat) from the base up through the crown.
  - Cover specialty palms and borderline-zone plants with **plant jackets** (drawstring bags).
  - Boulders and walls retain heat -- cover plants near them and let the thermal mass help.
  - Dense plantings act as natural plant blankets (microclimates).
- **Do NOT trim** anything. Leave brown/damaged foliage in place -- it insulates the plant.
- **Do NOT fertilize**. Plants are in dormancy or recovery.

### FEBRUARY
- **Continue to hold off on trimming**. Wait until freeze risk has passed (late February at the earliest, ideally mid-March).
- Increase watering to help roots recover from cold stress: switch from 3 days/week at 15 minutes to **every day for 15 minutes** per zone.
- Water at the base of plants, not on foliage.
- **Liquid copper fungicide**: Apply immediately after cold events. Spray the entire plant/tree from base to canopy (like "painting the whole tree"). Focus on palm crowns and hearts. Mix per label directions and use a backpack sprayer.
- After 1-2 weeks of increased watering + fungicide, apply **pesticide treatment** (Bifen I/T or neem oil). Weakened plants attract pests -- this is the "flu shot" for recovery.

### MARCH (First Major Maintenance Month)
- **Pruning/Trimming begins mid-March** once freeze risk is confirmed over.
  - For palms: trim off anything brown. Leave green fronds.
  - For shrubs/plants: find where brown meets green on the stem -- cut right at the green section (that is where new growth emerges).
  - Use hand clippers (Felco 2 recommended) for precision work.
  - Trim in a "mushroom style" on blooming plants: leave taller in the middle, round off at the bottom.
- **First fertilizer application of the year**: March is the ideal first round.
  - Apply **Palm Gain 8-2-12** granular to all tropicals (not just palms). "Chicken feed" it into open mulch areas.
  - For palms specifically: hit the 8-2-12 quarterly starting now (March, June, September, December).
  - Palms with potassium deficiency: add a water-soluble potassium supplement.
  - For newly recovering plants after freeze: consider an additional potassium shot.
- **Spring cutback season**: Separate interconnected plant groupings, rake back top layer of old mulch, clean slate for new mulch.
- **Weed patrol**: Pull or spray weeds every 10 days to 2 weeks until beds are clean.
- **Mulch refresh**: After cutback, apply fresh mulch to protect roots and retain moisture.

### APRIL
- **Fertilizer window continues**: Late March through early April is the safe period for first fertilization after freeze events (if you held off in March).
- Do NOT fertilize too early after cold damage -- wait until consistent warmth.
- Continue regular watering schedule.
- Monitor for pest activity on weakened plants.

### MAY
- Late April / early May: Fertilizer safe for plants that were heavily cold-damaged (give extra recovery time).
- Plants should be flushing out with new growth.
- Transition irrigation back toward normal schedule if it was elevated for recovery.

### JUNE (Second Major Maintenance Month)
- **Second quarterly pruning/trimming round**.
  - Hard cutback on shrubs and blooming plants.
  - Sanchezia: hard trim in summer (this is its heavy trim season).
  - Trim Pygmy Date Palms (twice a year -- this is one of the two).
  - Louisiana Red Ti plants: trim down to about 4 feet tall (twice a year trim).
  - Burl Marks / Snowbush: trim back (twice a year cycle); they flush out within 2 months.
  - Alocasia: trim back 3 times a year to maintain fullness at the base.
  - Song of India: nip the tops to promote branching/fullness.
- **Second fertilizer application**: Palm Gain 8-2-12 for all tropicals.
  - BGI Bougainvillea fertilizer for Bougainvillea.
  - Blooming fertilizer for flowering tropicals.
- **Rainy season begins**: Benefit of natural rainfall for new plantings.
- Watch for fungus with increased humidity -- apply copper fungicide as needed.

### JULY
- **Avoid planting new material in July/early August** -- extreme heat makes establishment very difficult and watering demands are intense.
- Imperialis Bromeliads struggle during July-August heat.
- Continue regular maintenance and watering.
- Rock beds can create heat pockets -- ensure plants in rock areas are heat-tolerant varieties (Dwarf Bougainvillea, Song of India, Dwarf Clusia).

### AUGUST
- **Continue to avoid new plantings** until late September.
- Heat index at its peak.
- Monitor irrigation closely -- plants in full sun need extra water.
- Brazilian Red Cloaks in full sun: add a soaker hose or extra bubbler for additional irrigation.

### SEPTEMBER (Third Major Maintenance Month)
- **Third quarterly pruning/trimming round**.
  - General cutback across the landscape.
  - Alocasia: third annual trim.
- **Third fertilizer application**: Palm Gain 8-2-12 for all tropicals.
  - Blooming fertilizer for flowering plants (second or third round).
- **Late September: Ideal planting time begins**.
  - Plants get established before winter.
  - Benefit of continued rainstorms.
  - A whole season of growth before next winter cold.
- New plantings protocol:
  - Amend soil: 50% Black Cow, 25% Peat Moss, 25% Pine Bark Nuggets.
  - Top-coat with **Osmocote Plus** (gentle root starter fertilizer -- will not burn new roots).
  - Osmocote feeds for the first 3 months; then switch to regular fertilizer.

### OCTOBER
- **Early October: Still ideal for new plantings**.
- **Fourth trimming time frame** (October-November per the "March, June, October, November" schedule mentioned for hard cutbacks).
  - Sanchezia: light trim in fall only -- leave as much foliage as possible for winter insulation.
  - General rule: do NOT trim heavy in fall. Do selective/light trimming. Heavy foliage protects plants from cold.
- Continue watering but start tapering as temperatures cool.

### NOVEMBER
- **Light cutback window** continues from October.
- Begin reducing irrigation frequency as weather cools.
- Top up mulch for winter root protection and moisture retention.
- **Pre-winter mulch application**: Protects root systems, holds moisture, insulates during cold snaps.

### DECEMBER (Fourth Major Maintenance Month -- Conditional)
- **Quarterly fertilizer application #4** -- but only if winter looks warm. If cold/freeze is expected, hold off.
  - Palm Gain 8-2-12 if conditions allow.
- Palms: hit fertilizer in December if temperatures are mild.
- **Freeze prep** if cold forecasts appear (see January protocol).
- Christmas lights for freeze protection: incandescent bulbs from base to crown on sensitive specimens.
- **Cover, wrap, and protect** borderline-zone tropicals.
- Hibiscus will not be in bloom during December -- this is normal.
- Add mulch as insulation layer before cold events.
- **Do NOT trim** if a freeze is forecasted -- foliage insulates the plant.

## 2. Per-Plant Maintenance Notes

### Palms (General)
- **Fertilizer**: Palm Gain 8-2-12, four times a year (March, June, September, December).
- **Trimming**: Only remove brown fronds. Never cut green fronds. If green, leave it.
- **Fungicide**: Liquid copper fungicide focused on the crown/heart of the palm after cold events or temperature swings.
- **Pest/Disease**: Queen Palms have had fungus issues in recent years. Sylvester Palms carry a disease concern -- treat with a pest control company a couple times a year.
- **Freeze recovery**: Palm crowns may take until June-July to show new fronds. Be patient.
- **Over-pruning warning**: Every cut is an open sore for disease/pest entry. Prune only at quarterly intervals.
- **Do NOT leave palm trunk cuts exposed** -- they invite pest, bugs, and fungus.

### Pygmy Date Palm
- **Trimming**: Twice a year to maintain natural fullness.
- **Fertilizer**: Palm Gain 8-2-12 quarterly.
- **Style**: Keep thick and full rather than over-trimmed for a natural look.

### Foxtail Palm / Alexander Palm / Triangle Palm
- **Maintenance**: Low to moderate. Follow quarterly fertilizer schedule.
- **Freeze**: Wrap crown with Christmas lights and plant jacket if serious freeze expected.

### Penangga Coronada (Bottle Palm relatives)
- **Fertilizer**: Palm Gain 8-2-12, every quarter -- March, June, September, December (if warm).
- Stake new installations with rebar.
- Palm fertilizer critical to develop a strong trunk.

### Eureka Palm
- **Trimming**: Can trim up the bottom to reveal bamboo-like trunks, or leave full and thick.
- **Fertilizer**: 8-2-12 four times a year. Potassium deficiency shows as yellowing -- add granular right away.
- Very slow grower; use compost and fertilize regularly.

### Clusia (Kucia/Kousia)
- **Fertilizer**: Needs extra feeding in shade locations. Use Palm Saber or standard fertilizer.
- **Trimming**: Can be hedged for a wall effect or left more natural. Typically trimmed as needed for shape.
- Grows faster than Green Buttonwood -- expect more maintenance.
- **Shade note**: In shade, Clusia may show deficiencies. Increase fertilizer frequency.
- Hardy hedge plant. Dwarf Clusia tolerant of rock/heat beds.

### Crotons (Croins)
- **Maintenance**: Low maintenance once established.
- **Trimming**: Minimal needed for compact varieties (Mammy, Pinocchio, Dwarf Banana, Gold Dust, Icone).
- **Pest concerns**: Can have pest problems -- drench with Bifen I/T two to three times a year.
- Thrive in sun for best color.

### Bougainvillea (Buganvillia)
- **Fertilizer**: **BGI Bougainvillea Fertilizer** -- granular along the base, or Osmocote. Also responds well to blooming fertilizer 2-3 times a year. Loves feeding; blooms appear 2-3 days after fertilizing.
- **Watering**: Do NOT overwater. Less water = more blooms.
- **Trimming**: Needs regular maintenance; can get "crazy and wild." Trim to control size.
- **Style**: Higher maintenance plant. Not for hands-off gardeners.
- Dwarf Helen Johnson variety: lower maintenance than standard.

### Sanchezia (Sesia/Sesy)
- **Trimming**: Hard trim in **summer**. Light trim in **fall** -- leave as much foliage as possible for winter insulation.
- **Do NOT heavy-trim in fall** -- leaves the plant burnt and vulnerable to cold.
- **Freeze sensitivity**: Does not like cold. After freeze, turns brown and goes on "life support." Do NOT cut back brown foliage until freeze season is over (late February/early March). Brown foliage insulates the plant.
- **Recovery**: After spring cutback, hit with insecticide (Bifen I/T or TriStar) drench, increase water, and fertilize in March. Within 3 months, plants look like nothing happened.
- Grows to 6-8 feet. Filtered light or full sun.

### Ixora (Exora) -- Dwarf Taiwanese
- **Maintenance**: Very low. Stays compact and small with little leaves.
- **Blooms**: 10 months out of the year.
- **Trimming**: Minimal -- stays naturally rounded and tidy.
- **Note**: Larger Ixora varieties have a tendency to get diseased easily. Stick to dwarf varieties for fewer problems.

### Bromeliads (Burmilads/Vermilads)
- **Watering**: They hold water in their cups/cones. Spray out cups every couple of weeks to prevent stagnant water and mosquitoes.
- **Mounting**: Mount at an angle so water fills and drains, not sits.
- **Root Rot**: Will die from root rot if sitting in water. In wet areas, plant in raised pots.
- **Nutrients**: Epiphytes -- get nutrients from cups/cones, not roots. Do not require heavy fertilization.
- **Trimming**: Use kitchen shears or Felco pruners to clean up. Remove dead mother plants as pups take over.
- **Sun tolerance varies by variety**: Johannis Bromeliads handle sun; Margaret/Margarita Bromeliads handle both sun and shade; Imperialis Bromeliads struggle in July-August heat.
- Fireball, Lemon Lime, Margarita varieties for mounting on trees.

### Anthurium (Antiloo)
- **Light**: Filtered light to shade. Year-round color provider.
- **Maintenance**: Low. Good for shaded corners and understory planting.
- **Trimming**: Minimal required.

### Aglaonema (Agonas/Agleneema) -- Silver Bay / "Diamond Frost"
- **Light**: Low light to filtered light. Excellent for deep shade.
- **Maintenance**: Very low. Fantastic lowlight plant grouping.
- **Can test**: Aglaonema can grow in very shady environments with no direct light.

### Song of India
- **Trimming**: Nip the tops to force branching. Can be trained on a trellis.
- **Heat tolerant**: Suitable for rock bed plantings.
- **Maintenance**: Moderate -- trim as needed for shape.

### Hibiscus
- **Blooming**: Trim to promote new blooms. Hard cutback promotes flushing.
- **Trimming**: "Mushroom style" -- tighter on sides, taller in middle.
- **Blooming plants are still trimmed** -- do not skip trimming because flowers are present.
- Dormant/non-blooming in December. Normal seasonal cycle.
- **Fertilizer**: Blooming fertilizer 2-3 times a year.
- Fertilizer timing: March, June, September.

### Fire Spike (Magenta)
- **Watering**: Needs consistent water. If wilting, check irrigation immediately.
- **Blooming**: More sun and filtered light = more blooms.
- **Freeze**: After cold snap/freeze, cut all the way down to the base. Old growth will be ratty. New growth flushes out from the base.

### Brazilian Red Cloak
- **Light**: Filtered light ideal. Can handle full sun with extra irrigation (soaker hose/bubbler).
- **Blooming**: 8-10 months of blooms per year.
- **Watering**: Extra water = more blooms. Add a bubbler or soaker hose in full sun.
- **Maintenance**: Low once established.

### Desert Rose
- **Watering**: Do NOT overwater. Less water = more blooms.
- **Fertilizer**: BGI Bougainvillea Fertilizer works well. Granular along the base or Osmocote.
- **Trimming**: Trim very, very little. Let it flush out and bloom naturally.
- **Blooming fertilizer**: Loves it 2-3 times a year (March, June, September timing).
- Also responds well to Palm Gain 8-2-12.
- Ideal as a long-term potted plant.

### Copper Leaves / Red Copper Leaves
- **Fertilizer**: Hit in March, June, September, December cycle.
- **Trimming**: Part of the standard quarterly cutback. Separate groupings during spring cleaning.

### Alocasia (Allocations)
- **Trimming**: Three times a year to maintain fullness at the base.
- **Note**: After trim, they "paddle all the way around" as they regrow.

### Gold Mound
- **Maintenance**: Compact, stays small. Ideal for sun environments.
- **Trimming**: Minimal. Once a year or as needed.

### Louisiana Red Ti Plants
- **Trimming**: Twice a year (every six months). Cut down to about 4 feet tall; they flush back out to 8-10 feet.
- Low maintenance when placed in the proper spot.

### Burl Marks / Snowbush
- **Trimming**: Twice a year. After heavy cutback, flush out within 2 months.

### Plumbago
- **Propagation tip**: Let cuttings dry out for a couple days before replanting.
- **Maintenance**: Low once established.

### Clumping Bamboo
- **Maintenance**: Can be maintained at any height (4, 6, 10, 20 feet).
- **Trimming**: Couple times a year. Easily maintained to desired size.

### Dwarf Bougainvillea
- **Heat tolerant**: Can handle rock bed plantings.
- **Trimming**: Can handle some extra water compared to standard Bougainvillea.
- Maintained in clean lines or left casual.

## 3. Emergency Protocols

### Freeze Recovery Protocol (Step-by-Step)

**Before the Freeze:**
1. Water heavily 1-2 days before the freeze. Double your normal irrigation time (e.g., 40 minutes instead of 20).
2. The day of the freeze, water again early in the morning. Let it soak in before evening.
3. Cut water completely the evening of the freeze -- no water on leaves overnight.
4. Wrap sensitive palms and tropicals with **incandescent Christmas lights** from base to crown for heat.
5. Cover with **plant jackets** (drawstring fabric bags). Tuck tight at the base.
6. Boulders and walls provide thermal mass -- cover plants near them for extra warmth.
7. Top up mulch around root zones for insulation.

**After the Freeze (Week 1):**
1. **Do NOT trim**. Leave all brown/damaged foliage. It insulates new growth underneath.
2. Increase watering: every day for 15 minutes (vs. normal 3 days/week for 15 minutes). Water at the base, not on foliage.
3. Apply **liquid copper fungicide** immediately. Spray the entire plant from base to canopy. Focus on palm crowns/hearts. Use a backpack sprayer with the label-recommended mix rate.

**After the Freeze (Week 2):**
4. Apply **pesticide treatment**: Bifen I/T (1 oz per gallon of water), neem oil, or TriStar. Use as a drench for individual plants or spray for entire garden. Weakened plants attract bugs -- this is preventive.

**After the Freeze (Week 3-4+):**
5. Continue daily watering for 2-3 weeks. Watch for new green growth emerging below the brown.
6. **Do NOT fertilize yet.** Plants are still in dormancy recovery.

**Mid-March (Freeze Season Over):**
7. Now trim: cut down to where brown meets green. For plants brown to the ground, cut to the base (they will regrow from roots).
8. Fertilize with Palm Gain 8-2-12. Add potassium supplement for extra recovery boost.
9. Apply insecticide drench (Bifen I/T or TriStar) around the base.
10. Within 3 months, plants should recover and look as if nothing happened.

**Palm-Specific Freeze Recovery:**
- Palm crown is the most critical part. If the heart survives, the palm will recover -- but it may take until **June or July** to see new fronds.
- Spray liquid copper fungicide directly into the crown/heart.
- Do NOT cut green fronds even if they look damaged.

### Pest Outbreak Protocol

**Preferred Products (rotate to prevent resistance):**
1. **Bifen I/T** -- Professional-grade systemic pesticide. 1 oz per gallon of water. Use as a spray or drench. Also treats termites. Safe after drying (pet-friendly). Recommended for all landscape customers at installation.
2. **Mallet** (Malathion alternative) -- Rotate with Bifen I/T every few months. Bugs build immunity to single products, so alternating is essential.
3. **Hose-end sprayer product** -- For quick mosquito/pest control before gatherings. Not as long-lasting as systemic products but available at big-box stores (Ace Hardware, Home Depot). Get maximum coverage underneath leaves.
4. **Neem oil** -- Organic alternative to Bifen I/T.

**Application Method:**
- Small-scale / spot treatment: drench individual plants.
- Large garden: use a battery-operated roll sprayer (5-gallon). Walk behind and spray into trees and understory. Get underneath leaves.
- For weed spraying: separate DeWalt sprayer (keep pesticide and herbicide equipment separate).

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Felco 2 pruners** -- favorite for all-purpose trimming (stems up to 1 inch).
- **Serrated knife** -- for agave trimming.
- **Backpack sprayer** -- for liquid copper fungicide and pesticide application.
- **Battery-operated roll sprayer** -- for large-scale pesticide application.
- **Wide-mouth garden totes** (45-gallon) -- for clipping collection during trimming.

### Fungus Prevention & Treatment

- **Liquid copper fungicide**: Primary defense. Apply after every freeze event, during temperature swings (warm-cold-warm-cold cycles), and when humidity is high.
- Spray from base to canopy. "Paint" the entire tree/plant.
- Palm crowns: spray directly into the heart.
- Increased watering = increased fungus risk. Always pair extra watering with fungicide.
- Areas with poor drainage or excessive roof runoff will need more frequent fungicide treatment.
- Wet mulch areas may need fungus treatment.

### Hurricane / Storm Recovery

- Check for broken limbs and damaged trunks.
- Similar protocol to freeze recovery: increase water, fungicide, pesticide.
- Staking protocol for newly installed or leaning palms: four rebar stakes in the ground.
- Dense plantings and Clusia hedges act as wind breaks -- protect interior plantings.
- Palm Gain 8-2-12 fertilization helps plants build storm resilience.

## 5. Key Do's and Don'ts

### DO:
- Fertilize 4x/year with Palm Gain 8-2-12 -- it acts as an immunity shot against pests.
- Prune on a quarterly schedule (March, June, September, December).
- Water heavily before a freeze (saturate the ground as insulation).
- Apply liquid copper fungicide after every freeze or temperature swing.
- Leave brown foliage on plants during winter -- it insulates new growth.
- Plant in late September through early October for best establishment.
- Use Osmocote Plus as a gentle root starter for new installations.
- Rotate pesticide products (Bifen I/T and Mallet) to prevent resistance.
- Test your soil -- send a sample to your local agricultural extension for deficiency analysis.
- Add gypsum to clay or compacted soil before planting.

### DON'T:
- Do NOT trim after a freeze. Wait until mid-March when freeze risk has passed.
- Do NOT fertilize immediately after a freeze. Plants are in dormancy/recovery.
- Do NOT leave water on leaves the evening before a freeze.
- Do NOT plant new material in July or early August (extreme heat + watering demands).
- Do NOT over-prune. Every cut is an open wound for disease and pests.
- Do NOT heavy-trim in fall -- leave foliage for winter insulation.
- Do NOT use weed matting under mulch. Mulch is meant to break down into soil; matting creates a weed seed bed on top of plastic.
- Do NOT ignore fertilization. Unfertilized plants are 99% more likely to attract pests (per University of Michigan milkweed study referenced in the channel).
- Do NOT skip fungicide after temperature swings (warm-cold-warm cycles breed fungus).
- Do NOT cut green palm fronds, even if they look damaged.
