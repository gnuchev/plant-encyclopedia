## How to Read This Guide

Each section is organized around a **star/focal plant**. Below each star, you will find what the designer repeatedly places around it, and in what role:

- **Backdrop** = planted behind the star, taller or equal height, creating a wall or screen
- **Skirt** = planted at the base/front, shorter, hiding trunks or bare stems
- **Accent** = a bold, sculptural companion providing contrast or visual weight
- **Ground cover** = the lowest tier, edging or carpet at the very front
- **Filler** = mid-height supporting plants that connect groupings

The designer consistently builds beds in **tiers/layers** (the "waterfall effect"):
> Ground cover --> Low shrubs --> Mid shrubs --> Tall shrubs --> Accent trees --> Canopy trees

---

## 1. Pygmy Date Palm (Phoenix roebelenii)

**Design role:** Mid-height focal tree (10-12 ft mature). Used flanking centerpiece trees or as standalone specimens.

| Companion Plant | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gold Dust Crotons | Skirt / ground tier | 3-4 plants at the base covering trunks; "lower tier effect" |
| Louisiana Red Copperleaf (Acalypha) | Backdrop | Planted behind the pygmy date; creates 4-5 ft colorful wall |
| Foxtail Ferns | Skirt / filler | Softens the base, camouflages stems |
| Iceton Crotons | Front skirt | Compact, colorful, lower than the palm canopy |
| Crotons (various) | Flanking | Flanked by 3+3 on either side of palm |
| Agave | Accent beside | Vertical accent next to the rounded palm |

**Layering formula (explicitly described):**
> Pygmy Date Palm (center) --> Louisiana Red Copperleaf (back) --> Gold Dust Crotons (front/base, 3-4 plants)

**Spacing:** Crotons at base ~2 ft on center from palm trunk.

---

## 2. False Agave (Furcraea foetida)

**Design role:** Vertical sculptural accent (4-5 ft). The designer's self-described "go-to plant" and "sculpture in the garden."

| Companion Plant | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Song of India (Dracaena reflexa) | Halo / surround | "Halo effect around the rear side of the false agave" |
| Alternanthera 'Little Ruby' | Skirt / ground cover | 1-gal plants, 1-2 ft on center; crowns around the agave base |
| Gold Mound (Duranta) | Skirt / ground cover | Small dollops at base; stays compact |
| Dwarf Taiwanese Ixora | Corner teardown | On corners where the bed height drops; stays 2 ft |
| Bougainvillea (Helen Johnson) | Companion | Planted beside young false agave; ground cover curves at base |
| Sterile Lantana (fire orange) | Skirt | Compact versions at the base |
| Evolvulus 'Blue My Mind' | Ground cover front | At the very front tip of the bed |
| Foxtail Ferns | Filler beside | Clusters of 3 nearby for texture contrast |
| Boulders | Design element | Flanking or beside the agave; agave on either side of boulder |

**Layering formula (explicitly described):**
> False Agave (star, center) --> Song of India (halo behind) --> Little Ruby (skirt) --> Gold Mound (accent base) --> Lantana (accent base)

**Spacing:** 1-gal Little Ruby at 1-2 ft on center. False agave to Gold Mound = 2 ft away. Everything at the bottom "crowns around" the star.

---

## 3. Clusia (Clusia guttifera / C. rosea)

| Travelers Palms | Additional buffering | Behind the Clusia for extra privacy in deep lots |

**Spacing:** Clusia planted 3 ft on center for hedge. 3 ft on center from Clusia row to the front Croton row.

**Designer note:** "Clusia as the backdrop... then [colorful plants] to the front. That green screen creates the canvas to let whatever is in front of it just shine."

---

## Quick-Reference: Designer's Favorite "Controlled" Edge Plants

These are the plants she repeatedly uses along walkways, patios, and pool decks where she needs tight, non-sprawling growth:

- Dwarf Taiwanese Ixora
- Gold Mound (Duranta)
- Evolvulus 'Blue My Mind'
- Carissa Boxwood (Emerald Blanket variety)
- Variegated Schefflera arboricola
- Dwarf Clusia
- Liriope

**Designer quote:** "Dwarf ixoras are my go-to for that. So are Gold Mound, dwarf Clusia, variegated arbicola. Those are things that you can really keep and draw with, kind of curve with."

---

## Quick-Reference: Designer's "Brightness in a Dark Spot" Plants

For shade or filtered light areas, she consistently reaches for:

- **Song of India** — "The darker the location, the more white and green it gets"
- **Aglaonema Silver Bay** — "A bright spot in the garden... big leaves"
- **Sanchezia** — "A great bright tone in a dark spot"
- **Java White Copperleaf** — bright variegation in shade
- **Bromeliad (Margaret)** — handles shade and keeps color
- **Burle Marx Philodendron** — shiny leaves in low light
- **Xanadu Philodendron** — compact alternative to Burle Marx

---

## Quick-Reference: The "Rinse and Repeat" Principle

The designer's most-used technique: repeat the same pairing pattern across a bed to create rhythm.

**Example pattern:** Burle Marx --> Song of India --> Java White Copperleaf --> [break with boulder or accent] --> repeat

**Example pattern:** Anthurium cluster --> Sanchezia behind --> Pentas ground cover --> [break] --> Song of India --> Bougainvillea --> repeat

**Her rule:** "Plant in swaths. It gives you that professional look. A drift of Sanchezia, then it stops and breaks, then a drift of Burle Marx, then a drift of Crotons."
