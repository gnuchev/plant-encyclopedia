## Overview

Mounting bromeliads to trees creates a stunning tropical accent feature - columns of color climbing trunks, turning ordinary trees (even dead ones) into living sculptures in the garden. The designer references McKee Botanical Gardens in Vero Beach as inspiration, where bromeliads climb all the way up trees with variation of color, looking like "column after column of beautiful plants."

Bromeliads are **epiphytes** (transcribed as "epipites" / "epoites"). They do not take nutrients from the host tree. Their roots serve only as an attachment/support mechanism. The plants get their nutrients and water from their central cups/cones.

## Equipment and Materials

The following supplies are needed (all described as simple and easy to find):

1. **Zip ties** -- Three sizes:
   - **Small zip ties:** Used in combination with nails (nail method)
   - **Large zip ties:** Used to wrap around the entire tree trunk (wrap method)
   - **Medium zip ties:** For in-between situations

2. **Fence staples** (the larger variety) -- Preferred for small bromeliads and fireballs; hammered directly into the tree

3. **2-inch nails** -- Used in pairs, angled upward, to create anchor points for zip ties

4. **Landscape ribbon / landscape tie** -- Stretchy material that can be wrapped around the tree and easily cut off once the plant has attached. Can be disguised with moss.

5. **Pantyhose / knee-highs** -- An alternative tie material. They stretch and eventually disintegrate naturally.

6. **Moss** -- Used to disguise attachment points (landscape ties, exposed stems, hardware)

7. **Mini bungee cords** -- An option, but noted as expensive and not worth it compared to zip ties

8. **Wound sealant spray** -- A spray product applied to nail/screw holes in live trees. Creates a scab-like seal to protect against pests, bugs, and fungus.

9. **Kitchen shears** -- For trimming old leaves off bromeliads before mounting

10. **Felco pruners** -- For cutting stems and heavier cleaning

### Materials NOT Recommended

- **Wire:** Does not stretch well; not preferred
- **Fishing line:** Does not disintegrate, so you must remember to manually cut every single piece later. Avoid.

## Step-by-Step Mounting Process

### Step 1: Prepare the Bromeliad (Potted Plants)

1. Remove the bromeliad from its pot.
2. Remove as much soil as possible from the root ball. The designer sometimes uses a water spray to wash soil off the roots.
3. Identify the **mother plant** vs. the **pups** (offsets). Each bromeliad produces pups off the mother plant via a connecting stem. The mother plant eventually dies after producing pups -- it is okay to cut her out.
4. Remove dead/old leaves. Clean the plant up. This is best done at transplant time rather than after mounting, while you can easily access all sides.
5. Pull roots apart gently -- do not tug aggressively. Leave enough root structure for the plant to grab onto the tree.
6. Keep the plant light -- strip away excess soil and dead material so the attachment hardware can support it easily.

**Skin protection tip:** The designer's skin is very sensitive to bromeliad leaves (even those without teeth/spines). Recommendation: wear tube socks pulled up to the elbows under tight-fitting gloves with treading/grip. Rose gloves work but reduce dexterity.

### Step 2: Choose and Prepare the Tree

Two scenarios are covered:

#### Dead Tree
- Can be decorated freely, like a Christmas tree
- No need to worry about the number of holes
- Nails, screws, and fence staples can be used liberally
- No wound sealant needed
- The designer cut his dead tree to about 6 feet tall to create a column

#### Live Tree
- Limit the number of nail/screw holes
- **Must seal all holes** with wound sealant spray after nailing (see Wound Sealing section below)
- Alternatively, use the no-penetration tie method (landscape ribbon/pantyhose wrap) to avoid holes entirely
- The designer chose an **Ericuri palm** (a slow-growing palm) as the live-tree specimen -- because it will stay put and the bromeliads will be visible for years without the tree outgrowing them

### Step 3: Select Trunk Position

- **Bottom of the trunk:** Place larger, clumping varieties (e.g., Neoregelia 'Margarita' / Margaret) closer to the base
- **Middle and upper trunk:** Place climbing/trailing types that pup outward (e.g., Fireball, Lemon Lime) as you go up
- **Climb the tree:** Work from bottom to top, all the way around the trunk, creating a column effect
- **Leave room for growth:** Leave gaps/areas between mounted plants for spreading and pupping
- **Add companion epiphytes:** Bird's nest ferns can be piled around the bottom for a soft, pillowy base effect

### Step 4: Nail Placement Technique (Nail + Zip Tie Method)

This is the primary method for secure, long-term mounting:

1. Take a **2-inch nail**.
2. Drive it into the tree at an **upward angle** -- not straight in, but angled upward. This helps the plant sit in a cradle and not slide down.
3. Place a **second nail** a couple of inches to the side, also at an upward angle.
4. Center the bromeliad's stem/stock between the two nails.
5. Thread a **small zip tie** between/around both nails and the plant stem.
6. Wrap it to the back, tighten it snug.
7. Clip the excess zip tie tail.
8. The two nails on either side act as supports, while the zip tie locks everything together.

### Step 5: Fence Staple Method (for Small Plants)

Best for small bromeliads, especially Fireball types:

1. Take the bromeliad's stem.
2. Place a **large fence staple** over the stem.
3. Hammer the staple directly into the tree.
4. The plant is immediately secured -- "pop that in there and then it's done."

**Advantage over ribbon:** Fence staples hold firmly with no movement. Ribbon/ties tend to stretch and shift, especially as the plant grows heavier.

### Step 6: Tie/Wrap Method (No Holes -- for Live Trees)

If you want to avoid putting any holes in a live tree:

1. Take **landscape ribbon** (stretchy landscape tie material).
2. Wrap it around the tree trunk and the plant.
3. Tie it securely. The stretch in the material accommodates some growth.
4. **Alternative material:** Pantyhose or knee-highs work the same way and will eventually disintegrate on their own.
5. Disguise with **moss** draped over the tie for aesthetics.
6. Once the bromeliad's roots have attached to the tree bark, cut the tie away.

## Wound Sealing (Live Trees)

### Why It Is Necessary

- **Hardwood trees** heal over their own wounds naturally and generally tolerate nailing without issue.
- **Palm trees do NOT heal over wounds.** If you put a hole in a palm, there will always be a hole there. This leaves the tree exposed to pests, bugs, and fungus.
- Sealing is essential when nailing into any live tree, but especially palms.

### How to Apply

1. Drive your nails/screws into the live tree.
2. Shake the wound sealant spray can well (it can get clogged).
3. Spray directly onto and around each hole.
4. Allow to dry completely before mounting the plant.
5. The spray creates "almost like a scab" over the wound, protecting it from pests and pathogens.
6. **If you make mistakes** (extra holes, nails that loosen and need repositioning), apply a **second treatment** over the old holes.

The designer uses a specific spray product (not named as a sponsorship) and notes there are "several products on the market" for this purpose.

## Angling for Drainage

### Why Angle Matters

- If bromeliads are mounted **straight upright** (as if planted in the ground), water collects and sits in the central cups indefinitely.
- **Standing water breeds mosquitoes** and can cause rot.
- Angling allows rainwater to fill the cups and then **drain out** naturally.

### How Much Angle

- Mount the bromeliad at a **slight outward angle** from the tree -- tilted so the open cup faces slightly downward/outward rather than straight up.
- The designer describes it as the plant "shooting right out there saying hello as you walk through the garden" versus pointing straight up.
- Every rain event fills the cups and then drains out.

### Aesthetic Benefit

- The angled look is also more visually appealing -- the designer personally prefers it over the straight-up look, noting "I see them often straight up like we were to plant them in the ground. But I personally like this look."

## Bromeliad Species for Mounting

### Best for Tree Mounting (Climbing/Pupping Types)

| Species (Corrected) | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Neoregelia 'Fireball'** (Neo Fireball) | **Top pick for mounting.** Pups prolifically in every direction. Best mounted with fence staples. Can be mounted with just a single staple. |
| **Neoregelia 'Lemon Lime'** | Good vertical climber for mid-trunk mounting. |
| **Neoregelia 'Margarita' / Margaret** | Dark-toned, clumping variety. Best placed **near the base** of the tree. Does not attach as well to vertical surfaces -- takes a long time to grip. Can handle sun and filtered light/shade. Keeps dynamic color in various light conditions. Very long-lived (10+ years). Both Johannis and Margaret are in the Neoregelia ("Neo") family. |
| **Neoregelia 'Johannis'** | Sun-tolerant. Green and yellow with pink tips. Handles bounce-back heat from pavers. |
| **Silver Odora bromeliad** | Large specimen bromeliad. Small root ball can be cut significantly for planting near tree roots. |

### Less Suitable for Vertical Mounting

| Species | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Neoregelia 'Margarita' / Margaret** | Clumping habit -- does not attach well to vertical surfaces. Use near the base. |
| **Imperialis bromeliad** | Large (4 ft tall x 3-4 ft wide), singular trunk, does not produce pups. Better as a ground accent than a tree-mount. |

### General Notes on Species Selection

- **Pupping habit is key.** Plants that pup in multiple directions (like Fireball) will naturally colonize the tree over time, creating the "column" effect.
- Species that clump tightly (like Margaret/Margarita) are better at the base where they can rest rather than cling vertically.
- Plants in the **Neoregelia family** are generally tough and sun-tolerant.

## Host Tree Selection

### Good Host Trees

| Tree Type | Why |
|---|---|
| **Dead trees / stumps** | No restrictions on nailing; can be decorated freely like a Christmas tree. Cut to desired height (e.g., 6 ft) and turn into a bromeliad column/sculpture. |
| **Slow-growing palms (e.g., Ericuri palm)** | Tree stays put, so mounted plants remain visible at accessible heights for years. |
| **Coconut palms** | Mentioned as a mounting host. The designer placed a grouping on top of a coconut palm trunk. |
| **Hardwood trees (oaks, etc.)** | Heal over nail wounds naturally. Many people have attached material to hardwoods "with not a problem." |
| **Stumps (e.g., oak stumps)** | Drill a hole, tuck bromeliads around and in it, add moss -- creates a natural planter effect. |
| **Kabato palm (and similar tall palms)** | Bromeliads can climb them and fill the vertical space over time. |

### Considerations for Host Tree Selection

- **Palm trees require wound sealing** if nailing into live specimens (they do not heal over holes).
- **Slow-growing trees are preferred** so the bromeliads remain at viewable/accessible heights.
- **Both dead and alive trees work** -- the technique simply changes (free nailing vs. sealed nailing or tie-only method).

## Orchid Mounting

### Same Technique? Key Differences

The designer had **Phalaenopsis orchids** (transcribed as "felonopsis") already mounted on the same tree and wanted to combine them with bromeliads.

#### Similarities
- Orchids are also epiphytes and can be mounted to tree trunks.
- The same tree can host both orchids and bromeliads.
- The same nail + zip tie or tie method can be used.

#### Differences
- **Orchids were originally mounted using landscape ribbon (tie method)** because the tree was alive and the designer did not want to screw/nail into it at the time.
- Ribbon has a tendency to **stretch and shift**, causing the orchid to move around -- this is noted as a disadvantage compared to nail/staple methods.
- The designer's vision: orchids **draping downward** with white blooms, and bromeliads **upright** -- creating a combined column effect of draping orchids and upright bromeliads.
- Orchids can be small enough to use fence staples if desired.
- Moss is typically placed around orchid mounts to disguise the tie and provide moisture retention.

## Maintenance of Mounted Plants

### Cleaning and Trimming
- Remove dead/old leaves at the time of transplant (easiest access).
- Ongoing trimming: remove dead mother plants as they die off after pupping. The pups carry on.
- Kitchen shears work well for leaf removal; Felco pruners for stems.

### Pups / Offsets on Mounted Plants
- Each bromeliad produces pups off the mother plant via a stem.
- The mother plant eventually dies after producing pups -- this is normal.
- Pups will grow in multiple directions from the mount point, naturally expanding coverage on the tree.
- **You can remove dead mother plants** without harming the pups. The pups are independent once established.
- On the tree, plants will "multiply and multiply and multiply" -- creating the sculpture effect over time.
- If bromeliads are on the ground and have trailed extensively with many stems, they are actually ideal candidates for mounting at that point because "they have all these stems and now they become sculptures in the garden."

### Watering Mounted Bromeliads
- Bromeliads get nutrients and water from their **central cups/cones**, not from soil or roots.
- Rain naturally fills the cups when plants are mounted outdoors.
- **Flush the cups** once a week or every other week: bring a hose and spray into the center of the bromeliad so water overflows and flushes out the cups. This prevents standing/stagnant water.
- Mounted at an angle, cups will partially self-drain with each rain event.
- Bromeliads "can handle more water than a typical" expectation -- they hold water in their cups and that is normal and healthy, as long as it is flushed periodically.
- Mosquito prevention is a key reason to both angle plants and flush cups regularly.

### Watering Mounted Orchids
- Orchids mounted on trees receive moisture from rain and humidity.
- Moss placed around orchid roots at the mount point helps retain moisture.
- No specific additional watering regimen mentioned beyond what the environment provides.

## Design Considerations

### Patterns and Layout on the Trunk

- **Bottom to top:** Work from the base of the trunk upward, placing plants all the way around.
- **Clumping varieties at the base:** Larger, non-climbing types (e.g., Margaret/Margarita) near the bottom where they can rest on the trunk's wider sections.
- **Climbing varieties higher up:** Fireball, Lemon Lime, and other pupping types as you ascend.
- **All the way around:** Do not just mount on one face of the tree. Wrap plants around the full circumference.
- **Leave spacing for growth:** Leave gaps and open areas between plants so they can spread and pup into those spaces over time.

### Height and Spacing

- On a dead tree cut to ~6 feet, the entire trunk from bottom to top can be covered.
- On a live tree, work with the accessible trunk height; bromeliads will climb further as pups develop.
- Space nails/mount points far enough apart that each plant has room to produce 2-3 pups before they merge with the neighbor.

### Combining Plants for Effect

- **Orchids + Bromeliads:** Draping orchids (Phalaenopsis with hanging white blooms) combined with upright bromeliads create a layered column effect.
- **Bird's nest ferns at the base:** Epiphytes that can be piled around the bottom of the trunk for a "soft pillowy effect" as a base layer.
- **Color variation:** Mix species with different colors (dark Margaret tones, bright Fireball reds, green-yellow Lemon Limes) to create variation reminiscent of the columns seen at McKee Gardens.
- **The sculpture concept:** A well-mounted tree becomes a sculpture in the garden -- a statement piece and standout feature.

### Using Stumps

- Dead tree stumps can also be used: drill a hole, place bromeliads around and in it, add moss, and drape it for a natural planter look.
- Oak tree stumps work particularly well for this purpose.
