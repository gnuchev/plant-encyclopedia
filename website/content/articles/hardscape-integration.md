## 1. Boulder Types and Selection

### Coquina Boulders
- The designer's premium boulder choice for focal-point impact pieces
- Natural Florida stone with organic holes, grooves, and curves
- Some have holes where you can plant a Bromeliad or succulent directly into the boulder
- Used as centerpiece boulders in beds -- elevated and tilted up to show the full face
- Available in large statement sizes; pairs beautifully with tropical plantings
- More expensive than Tennessee boulders but offer a unique Florida aesthetic

### Tennessee Boulders / Tennessee Fieldstone
- The designer's workhorse boulder; she brings truckloads back from trips to Tennessee
- Available in giant pallets from stone yards -- cost-effective for large quantities
- Comes in a gray-tone ("Greystone") palette
- Available in handheld sizes (pick up with your hands) up to large statement pieces
- Versatile: used as accent boulders, edging, retaining walls, waterfall construction, and step-downs
- Field stone variety is flat and stackable -- ideal for creating low retaining walls and boulder edging
- Tennessee Fieldstone waterfall installations create a rustic vibe around pool areas
- Can be tucked into planters to tie in with a nearby waterfall or water feature

### Cap Rock
- Large statement boulders used as focal points
- Typically hundreds of dollars per piece
- Giant cap rocks are impressive but not necessary -- basketball-sized or football-sized boulders create effective impact at lower cost

### Other Stone Types
- **River Jacks** -- rounded river stones, good for borders around water features, wet areas, and decorative beds; mixed with other stones for variation
- **Alabama White River Rock** -- bright white round rock; excellent contrast against dark mulch; use in landscape beds and around water features, NOT for walkways (round rock rolls)
- **Indian Creek Rock** -- a nice round rock that showcases water well; softer and easier to walk on than Tahitian gray granite; a good secondary walkway option or accent near water features
- **Mexican Beach Pebbles** -- decorative dark/black polished pebbles; used underneath fountains and as polished border accents; available in mini sizes
- **Crimson Red Stone** -- used for color accent mixing with other stone types
- **Basalt Columns** -- triple basalt column water features (from Aquascapes brand); used as standalone water feature centerpieces

---

## 2. Boulder Placement Rules

### Where to Place Boulders
- **Corner areas** -- Tennessee boulders on corners soften transitions and disguise the connection of two different edging types
- **Centerpiece of beds** -- Coquina boulders elevated in the center of a bed as the focal point
- **Flanking driveways** -- boulders framing driveway entrances with plantings wrapped around them
- **Along slopes** -- boulders on steep slopes to anchor and add visual interest where planting options are limited
- **At pathway endpoints** -- boulders marking the beginning or end of a garden section
- **Between edging transitions** -- where two types of edging meet, boulders mask the junction
- **Raised beds** -- Tennessee Fieldstone boulders creating subtle 6-inch raised areas for drainage improvement

### Size Guidelines
- You do not need giant expensive cap rocks -- basketball-sized to slightly-larger-than-football-sized boulders create effective impact
- Handheld boulders (pick up with your hands) work well scattered throughout a garden for texture change
- Mix sizes: have a main centerpiece boulder with smaller supporting boulders nearby

### Grouping Rules
- **Groups of three** -- three Coquina boulders with three pots sharing the same space creates an organic look in squared-off areas
- **Odd numbers** -- the designer consistently groups boulders in odd numbers (1, 3, 5)
- **Halo formation** -- place plants in a "halo" around boulders; Bromeliads, foxtail ferns, or lantana encircling the base
- **Triangle formation** -- foxtail ferns in triangle formation around a boulder on both sides of a focal point

### Placement Technique
- **Tilt boulders up** -- instead of laying flat, tilt the boulder forward/upward and pack soil behind it; this lets you see the full face from a distance and makes the boulder appear larger
- **Inset into the ground** -- dig a shallow trench and set the boulder so it looks like it has always been there, not like it was placed on top of the ground
- **Flattest part on bottom** -- when creating boulder retaining walls, put the flattest side down for stability and even appearance
- **Dig and mound** -- use the soil you dig out to elevate behind the boulder, making it look naturally inset while creating a raised bed effect
- **Plant behind** -- after tilting up, plant the back side with fronds or foliage that encroach around the boulder

## 3. Boulder + Plant Combinations

The designer repeatedly uses these pairings:

| Boulder Companion Plant | How It Is Used |
|---|---|
| **Foxtail Fern** | The go-to boulder framing plant; wraps around boulders with soft texture; used in swaths and triangle formations |
| **Foxtail Agave** (Agave attenuata) | Folds over top of boulders; develops a trunk over time; natural pairing with stone |
| **Blue Flame Agave** | Trio plantings alongside boulder retaining walls in full-sun succulent gardens |
| **Johannis Bromeliad** | Halo around boulders; tolerates full sun and paver heat; flamboyant green/yellow with pink tips |
| **Imperialis Bromeliad** | Planted around boulders; color varies by sun exposure (more purple in filtered light, greener in shade) |
| **Yellow Lantana** (compact/sterile variety) | Softens boulders; folds over the top; stays rounded and compact |
| **Golden Sedum** | Low ground cover directly around boulder bases; looks excellent against stone |
| **Portulaca** | Planted right below boulders as colorful ground-level accent |
| **Blue My Mind** (Evolvulus) | Low border near boulders; pop of blue color; handles heat well |
| **False Agave** | Vertical accent next to Coquina boulders; strong structural contrast |
| **Song of India** (Dracaena reflexa) | Bright yellow-green foliage; clusters of three near boulders in darker garden areas |
| **King Sago** | Vertical structural plant spotted between Tennessee boulders |
| **Crotons** (Mammy, Petra, Pinocchio) | Color contrast planted behind and around boulders |
| **Golden Dewdrop** | Halo backdrop behind Coquina boulders with "Rubies" (dwarf Ixora) in nook areas |

### Key Principle
> "Almost every time I do a unique boulder in a landscape, I'll put some foxtail ferns or some agave or some Bromeliads, whatever the budget allows, to kind of frame that boulder to give it a highlight. Having a little bit of a halo of these guys really adds interest."

## 4. Gravel Types

### Tahitian Gray Granite (Primary Choice)
- **The designer's favorite and most-used stone for pathways and ground cover**
- Speech-to-text variations: "Tahesian," "tahan," "tesan," "tiian," "deian," "TSH and GRE"
- Has jagged edges (NOT round) -- this is critical: jagged pieces knit together and stay put
- Multiple sizes within one batch allow small pieces to fill between larger pieces, creating a solid locked surface
- Does not roll, does not move once compacted
- After a few rains, becomes a nice solid base without needing a compactor or tamper
- **Preferred sizes:**
  - **Half-inch** -- smallest variety; the "perfect little thing"; knits together tightly; nicest to walk on between flagstone grooves
  - **3/4-inch** -- a middle option; slightly easier to walk on
  - **Inch to inch-and-a-half** -- the designer's standard walkway size; compacts well; stays put in drainage areas and heavy rain
  - **1 to 3-inch** -- large variety; used for decorative beds and creating visual borders between areas
- Best rock for walking paths -- you can walk on it barefoot; packs down tight; great crunch sound underfoot
- Can handle heavy rain runoff in drainage easements (use the larger size in flood-prone areas)
- Complements most house colors due to neutral gray tones
- Coverage: approximately 100 square feet per yard

### Regular Gray Granite
- Not the Tahitian variety but similar properties
- Mounds down nice and tight; packs well
- More affordable alternative
- Works well as pathway stone and border areas

### Indian Creek Rock
- Round rock with a softer feel underfoot
- Softer and easier to walk on than Tahitian gray granite
- Good secondary option for pathways, especially near seating or fire pit areas with bare feet
- Does have some round pieces that can move, unlike the purely jagged granite
- Pairs well with water features due to how it showcases water

### White River Rock (Alabama White)
- Round, bright white decorative stone
- **Use for landscape beds, NOT walkways** -- round rock rolls and is not walkable
- Excellent contrast against dark mulch and dark-foliaged plants
- Use the inch-and-a-half variety in landscape beds and around water features
- Great for wrapping around water features like a "string of pearls"
- Comes in small and large sizes for mixing

### Tan Peach River Rock
- Decorative round river rock in tan/peach tones
- Used for decorative bed borders near driveways to prevent mulch runoff
- Not a walkable rock -- it moves and molds

### Brown River Rock
- Round decorative option for stone beds
- Same rules as white: not for walking, ideal for decorative features

---

## 5. Gravel Usage

### Pathways
- Tahitian gray granite is the go-to pathway stone
- Jagged pieces are mandatory for walkways -- round stones roll and are unusable for walking
- Pathway stone installation order:
  1. Remove sod or existing ground cover
  2. Tamp down solid soil base
  3. Lay commercial weed barrier fabric
  4. Install edging on both sides (aluminum alloy or Buta)
  5. Fill with stone
  6. Tamp down (or let rain compact naturally after a few rains)
- The stone does not disappear over time -- it is a permanent, no-maintenance surface
- Consider stone pathways over grass in shady areas, high-traffic areas, or drainage easements where grass struggles

### Bed Topping / Decorative Stone Beds
- Use round decorative rock (white, brown, or tan river rock) for landscape beds
- Always lay weed barrier underneath decorative stone
- Use aluminum alloy edging to separate stone beds from mulch beds -- prevents mixing
- Stone beds are ideal when a bed is sandwiched between two hardscape areas (driveway and walkway) to prevent mulch runoff
- Stone beds are lower maintenance than mulch beds: no replenishment needed, weeds are minimal with good barrier
- Tough plants can be planted through the weed barrier into stone beds: small groupings of succulents, agave, foxtail ferns

### Mixing Stones
- Combine different stone types for visual interest: Tennessee Fieldstone + River Jacks + gray granite
- Use aluminum alloy edging to separate different stone colors/types within the same area
- Two-tone stone designs (Tahitian gray granite on walkway, white river rock in adjacent bed) create contrast
- Around water features: small white Alabama River Rock at edges transitioning to larger white Alabama River Rock in the basin

### Pot Drainage Layering
- For large planters: big gravel at the bottom, weed barrier, then smaller gravel, weed barrier, then soil mix
- This creates proper drainage in pots and reduces weight versus solid soil fill

## 6. Edging Systems

### Aluminum Alloy Edging

**What It Is:**
- A thin metal edging strip that creates a clean, nearly invisible edge line
- About 4 inches tall (4-and-a-half inches)
- Has a top ribbed part visible above ground; the rest is buried
- Creates a permanent, defined barrier between materials

**Where to Use It:**
- **Stone from mulch** -- the primary use; keeps stone beds and mulch beds from mixing
- **Stone from stone** -- separating two different colored or textured stone areas
- **Pathway borders** -- both sides of every stone pathway to keep stone compacted and in place
- **Stone from sod/grass** -- works but is NOT the best choice here (mowers can damage it)
- **Around water features** -- containing stone borders
- **Where grade shifts** -- along slopes to keep stone from migrating downhill

**How to Install:**
- Stake it into tamped-down soil along the desired border line
- Push it down so only the top ribbed edge is visible
- The stone and mulch push up against it on either side, making it nearly invisible
- It is permanent once installed
- Can be picked up and repositioned if you want to change bed designs

**Advantages:**
- Nearly invisible once stone and mulch are in place
- Creates an "invisible edge line" -- best choice when you want a clean look without visible edging
- Permanent; no maintenance
- Effective at preventing material migration

**Limitations:**
- Mowers can bend or sink it if they run over it repeatedly
- NOT recommended for grass-to-mulch borders in properties with aggressive mowing crews
- Use Buta edging instead where mowers are a concern

### Buta Edging (the designer's "absolute favorite")

**What It Is:**
- A thick, durable, flexible landscape edging product
- Available in multiple colors including charcoal
- Two-stage edging system
- Stakes into the ground
- Can be curved, manipulated, and repositioned easily

**Where to Use It:**
- **Mulch from grass/sod** -- the preferred edging where mowers operate
- **Bed outlining** -- creating the crisp edge ("CIS whisp edge") around planting beds
- **Retaining soil** -- holds mulch and soil in beds that are on a rise above lower ground
- **Curved beds** -- highly pliable; easily follows curves and organic shapes

**Advantages:**
- Extremely durable -- you can run a truck over it and it stays put
- Mower-proof -- weed whackers and mower tires do not damage it
- Pliable and easy to curve for organic bed shapes
- Easy to reposition: pop it up with one hand, alter the curve, stake it back down
- Available in charcoal color that blends with most landscapes

**Best Practice:**
- Use Buta edging where it contacts grass/mowing areas
- Use aluminum alloy edging where it separates stone from mulch or stone from stone
- The designer often uses BOTH in the same garden -- different edging types for different junctions, which adds visual variety

### Boulder Edging
- Handheld Tennessee Fieldstone boulders leveled out in a line
- Creates a rustic retaining wall that doubles as edging
- Only needs to be about 6 inches high to solve drainage and grade issues
- Place flattest side down; dig a trench at varying depths so the tops of the boulders appear level
- Used to raise planting areas above wet/low spots
- Plants (foxtail ferns, agave, succulents) behind the boulder edging fill in the raised bed

### Concrete Edging
- The designer advises COVERING concrete edging with plants if you have it
- Concrete edging absorbs and radiates heat, which can damage adjacent plants
- Let plants spill over to insulate from heat transfer

## 7. Pathway Design Within Garden Beds

### Design Philosophy
> "Having a pathway, having a nice established pathway, gives you that secret garden feel."

The designer models pathway design after botanical gardens and tropical resorts.

### Width Guidelines
- **Minimum 2.5 feet** -- for pathways along the side of a house when space is limited (less than 9 feet total)
- **2 to 3 feet** -- standard garden walkthrough pathway
- **Broad openings** -- start and end pathways with wide, welcoming entrances; sometimes the end is even wider than the beginning
- If you have 20+ feet of space, center a pathway with layered landscaping on both sides

### Curves and Meandering
- Never make a straight pathway unless space demands it -- always add curves
- Every curve must have a REASON: a boulder, a bird bath, an agave, a specimen plant that draws the eye and justifies the path bending
- If you curve a path without a visual reason, people will just cut straight through
- Use a garden hose or extension cord to lay out the pathway shape before installing
- Block sight lines: plant something at each curve that blocks your view of what comes next -- this draws you further along the path

### Pathway Off a Pathway
- Create secondary pathways that branch off the main path
- These connect to seating areas, water features, or garden rooms
- A pathway from the patio leading to a secondary path leading to a garden feature creates destination-based design

### Materials Layering (Pathway Build)
1. Outline the path with a garden hose
2. Remove sod
3. Tamp down soil
4. Install edging on both sides (aluminum alloy for stone paths)
5. Lay weed barrier fabric
6. Fill with Tahitian gray granite (inch to inch-and-a-half for standard; 3/4-inch or half-inch for finer paths)
7. Tamp down or let rain compact naturally
8. Optional: inset flagstone pieces into the gravel for a stepping-stone effect

### Flagstone Pathway Installation
- Buy one pallet of flagstone for approximately 68 linear feet of pathway (~$600 per pallet)
- Get a mix of big and small pieces -- do NOT use all one size
- **Leveling base:** use crushed concrete millings (not sand); millings harden after several rains, locking flagstone in place; costs approximately $48 for a half-yard
- **Dry set** the flagstone: lay pieces on the millings base, use a rubber mallet to wedge them in tight
- Walk the path during installation -- if any step feels like a "stutter step" because a piece is too small, adjust immediately
- Flag stone can be loose-fitting (set in gravel with gaps) or tight-fitting -- both work
- Natural material should look natural and organic; nothing should appear overly uniform
- Materials list: rubber mallet, wheelbarrow, tamper, millings/setting sand, flagstone pallet, edging, weed barrier

### Maintenance Pathways
- Always create a maintenance access path (minimum 18 inches wide) behind deep garden beds
- This allows trimming, debris collection, and plant care from both the front and back of beds
- The designer's own garden has a stone maintenance path behind her main tropical buffer

---

## 8. Pavers

### Paver Types
- **Castle Scape pavers** -- 16 x 24 inch format; linear pattern; flat corners (not rounded); contemporary look
- Linear pattern is preferred over random pattern for larger deck areas to avoid visual busyness
- Flat-corner pavers require more precise compacting during installation but give a more modern, clean joint line
- Cost-effective: approximately $4 per square foot for standard paver sizes

### Paver Coping
- Platinum coping used along pool edges matching the paver color
- Consistency between paver color and coping creates a unified look

### Plants Near Pavers (Heat-Tolerant Selections)
Pavers radiate intense "bounce-back heat" that can burn sensitive plants. The designer's approved paver-edge plants:

| Plant | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Blue My Mind** (Evolvulus) | Stays compact and low; handles paver heat; nice blue border |
| **Johannis Bromeliad** | Handles sun and paver heat "like a champ" |
| **Ixora** (dwarf, Florida-friendly) | Blooms nicely; handles direct sun and paver heat |
| **Foxtail Fern** | Tough; handles heat from pavers and driveways |
| **Hibiscus** | Handles bounce-back heat well |
| **Yellow Thalia** | Tolerates intense heat |
| **Fire Bush** | Can handle intense reflected heat |
| **Crotons** | Various varieties tolerant of full sun conditions near hardscape |
| **Liriope / Green La** | Excellent between pavers and landscaping where no edging exists; staggers in to prevent mulch flow |

### Key Rule
> "Whatever you put along the edge of pavers, you want to make sure that it is tough, it's durable, it can handle that bounce-back heat -- because if not, you can really burn up a plant species quickly along the edge."

### Stone vs. Mulch Near Pavers
- Use stone (not mulch) in beds immediately adjacent to pavers and driveways
- Stone prevents mulch from washing onto pavers during rain
- Stone eliminates the constant maintenance of mulch migrating onto hardscape surfaces
- Start with edging, then stone border, then transition to mulch beds further from the hardscape

## 9. Retaining Walls

### Boulder Retaining Walls
- Use Tennessee Fieldstone boulders for subtle retaining walls
- Does not need to be massive -- even 6 inches of elevation change solves drainage problems
- Place flattest part of boulder on the bottom for stability
- Dig a trench at varying depths so boulders appear level across the top
- Pack soil behind and between boulders
- Plant behind the wall to soften the look (agave, foxtail ferns, succulents)

### Material Options for Retaining
The designer lists multiple retaining wall material choices:
- **Boulders** -- Tennessee Fieldstone or Coquina
- **Stack stone** -- traditional stacked stone walls
- **Coquina** -- natural Florida stone
- Each approach works; choose based on your aesthetic preference and budget

### Boulder Retaining Wall Technique
1. Dig a trench following the desired wall line (depth varies to account for different boulder sizes)
2. Set boulders with flattest side down
3. Pack soil tightly behind each boulder
4. The wall line should appear visually level even though the trench depth varies
5. Fill behind the wall with soil to create the raised bed
6. Plant the raised area with heat-loving or drainage-needing plants
7. The result: a natural-looking raised bed that solves drainage issues while adding visual charm

---

## 10. Fire Pit / Outdoor Living Integration

### Design Approach
- Fire pits and seating areas should be pulled OUT into the garden, not pressed against the house
- This creates the experience of sitting "within the garden" rather than looking at it from the house
- Landscape all the way around the fire pit perimeter so you are surrounded by plants

### Pergola + Fire Pit Combination
- Wood pergola over the fire pit area with the fire pit centered underneath
- Orient the fire pit to face a water feature or garden focal point
- Royal Palms used as columns around fire pit seating to create an outdoor "room" with canopy "roof"

### Fire Pit Stone Selection
- Do NOT use round rolling river rock for fire pit areas -- it is unstable underfoot
- Indian Creek Rock is a better choice for fire pit surrounds: softer to walk on, manageable with bare feet
- Tahitian gray granite is the best for surrounding pathways leading to fire pits

### Lighting Around Fire Pits
- String lights on poles create a soft glow for nighttime use
- Colored lights on water features complement the fire pit ambiance
- Landscape spotlights on surrounding palms and trees create a resort-like atmosphere

### Planting Around Fire Pits
- Keep plantings around fire pit/seating areas more controlled and trimmed back
- Use plants that wont encroach aggressively into seating space
- Royal Palms as vertical columns; medium understory plants as buffering walls

---

## 11. Landscape Lighting Integration

### Preferred Product
- Professional bronze light fixtures (Dauer brand for commercial installations)
- Full bronze construction handles salt conditions in coastal Florida
- 5-year bulb replacement warranty
- Retail versions available for DIY installation

### Light Types Used

**Spotlights:**
- The designer's primary landscape light
- Direct, focused beam for tall palm trees (Foxtail Palms, Royal Palms)
- Use higher wattage (7-watt) bulbs on tall trees, lower wattage (4-watt) on shorter palms
- This creates highs and lows -- a shading effect of light intensity across the garden
- For trees near seating areas: mount spotlights on gutter brackets behind the roofline to shine DOWN into canopy, avoiding glare in people's eyes

**Wall Lights:**
- Have a screen diffuser that widens and softens the light beam
- Ideal for plants under 5 feet tall: Agave, Anthurium, smaller palms
- Prevents the harsh "hot spot" circle that a spotlight creates on low plants
- Creates a full shadow effect showing the entire plant structure
- The designer uses wall lights on Agave specifically for the dramatic shadow play

### Lighting Design Philosophy
- **NO runway-style path lights** -- the designer strongly dislikes dotted pathway lights
- Instead: light the plants and trees themselves, letting their glow illuminate pathways indirectly
- Use varied bulb wattages to create depth: 7-watt on Foxtail Palms, 4-watt on Pygmy Date Palms
- The result looks like a resort: trees have different light levels creating a natural shading effect
- The shadow patterns from lit palms and Agave on walls and ground are part of the beauty

### Solar Lights
- Used in areas without electrical outlets
- Placed in key areas as supplements to main landscape lighting
- Work well in zones that get good daytime sun to charge
- Big enough bulbs to provide impact visible from a distance
- Positioned on fence lines or behind plants for silhouette lighting

### Oak Tree / Large Canopy Tree Lighting
- Problem: spotlights placed directly under a large oak near a seating area will shine into peoples eyes
- Solution: run the lighting wire up the inside of the house gutter, mount spotlights on gutter brackets on the BACK side (hidden)
- Spotlights shine from the roofline INTO the canopy, illuminating the prettiest parts of the tree
- Creates a gorgeous halo effect on the trunk and canopy without any glare on the seating area

## 12. Water Features

### Types Discussed
- **Tennessee Fieldstone waterfall** -- natural boulder waterfall with spillways; creates rustic vibe around pool areas
- **Basalt column water features** -- triple basalt columns (Aquascapes brand); standalone garden focal points
- **Granite water feature** -- granite basin with bamboo spout, surrounded by boulders
- **Koi pond** -- with Tennessee boulder spillways; two spillways at top spill water down boulders
- **Repurposed fountains** -- old fountain basins with sliced openings creating a rainfall effect; found on Facebook Marketplace for budget-friendly options
- **Wall water features, spouts, and bowls** -- common around pool areas

### Water Feature Placement
- Place the water feature at the primary sight line from every seating section
- Whether it is a water feature, fountain, pergola, or specimen palm -- put the focal point in the forefront of the most-viewed angle
- Water features are the designer's preferred focal point for backyard spaces

### Plants Around Water Features
- Plants near water features THRIVE on the humidity and constant moisture
- Recommended plants around water features:
  - **Cat Palms** -- backdrop planting; mature to ~9 feet; handle shade
  - **Hanging Orchids** -- nestle near water features; love the humidity
  - **Red Cone Ginger** -- ideal backdrop around corners behind pools or water features
  - **Various ferns and tropical foliage** -- love the humid microclimate
- "If you have a water feature, put some hanging orchids near it. Really let and unfold your plants around it. Nestle that water feature because they're going to love where they live."

### Water Feature Stone Selection
- Wrap the base of water features with river rock (white or brown) all the way around for a polished "string of pearls" look
- Use smaller river rock at the edges transitioning to larger river rock in the basin (so water flow does not move the stones)
- Indian Creek Rock showcases water beautifully due to its surface texture
- Mexican Beach Pebbles (black, mini size) underneath fountain basins for a clean dark base
- Tennessee Fieldstone within planters near a waterfall to tie the stone theme together

## 13. Rock Bed Plantings (Plants That Tolerate Rock/Heat)

Plants installed directly in stone beds (through weed barrier) must tolerate reflected heat, reduced soil moisture, and root-zone warmth from sun-heated stone.

### Confirmed Rock/Stone Bed Plants
| Plant | Tolerance Notes |
|---|---|
| **Blue Flame Agave** | Trio plantings in boulder-edged succulent stone beds; handles heat and moisture |
| **Foxtail Agave** (Agave attenuata) | Folds over boulders; handles heat; develops trunk over time |
| **False Agave** | Structural vertical accent in stone beds |
| **Foxtail Fern** | The go-to stone bed plant; frames boulders; handles full sun and heat |
| **Blue My Mind** (Evolvulus) | Low border in stone beds; pops against gray granite |
| **Johannis Bromeliad** | Handles sun, heat, and stone-bed conditions |
| **Imperialis Bromeliad** | Can handle full sun to shade; planted in and around stone |
| **Madagascar Palm** | Succulent tree in dedicated rock beds |
| **Golden Sedum** | Ground cover in stone beds around boulders |
| **Portulaca** | Low color at boulder bases in stone beds |
| **Succulents** (various) | General recommendation for rock-bed environments |
| **Quarterlina** (Caladium/Quarterline varieties) | Thrives in areas with bounce-back heat from deck and stone |
| **Yellow Lantana** (compact) | Folds over boulders in stone settings |

### Key Concept: Bounce-Back Heat
- Stone, pavers, concrete, and driveways all radiate absorbed heat back onto adjacent plants
- During the hottest part of the day, boulders heat up like "a hot water bottle" -- this is actually beneficial for cold-sensitive plants during winter, as boulders retain and slowly release warmth
- In summer, only heat-tolerant species should be placed near stone and hardscape
- The designer has burned plants by placing sensitive species too close to pavers -- learned from experience

| **Walking pathway** | Tahitian Gray Granite | 1/2" to 1.5" | Jagged; knits; stays put |
| **Pathway in rain/drainage area** | Tahitian Gray Granite | 1" to 1.5" | Larger size resists water movement |
| **Fine walking path** | Tahitian Gray Granite | 1/2" to 3/4" | Smooth walk; tight joints |
| **Decorative landscape bed** | White/Brown River Rock | 1.5" | Round; bright; decorative |
| **Near driveway border** | Tan Peach River Rock | varies | Prevents mulch runoff |
| **Around water features** | Alabama White River Rock | small + large | "String of pearls" effect |
| **Under fountains** | Mexican Beach Pebbles (mini) | small | Dark polished base |
| **Fire pit seating area** | Indian Creek Rock | varies | Soft on bare feet |
| **Mixed accent beds** | Tennessee Fieldstone + River Jacks | mixed | Visual variety |
| **Flagstone inset** | Natural flagstone on granite base | mixed sizes | Stepping stone + gravel |

## 16. Summary of Design Principles

1. **Mix edging types** -- use aluminum alloy where stone meets mulch, Buta where mowers operate, boulder edging for rustic transitions; the variety itself adds visual interest
2. **Every element needs a reason** -- pathway curves need a visual anchor (boulder, specimen plant); don't curve just to curve
3. **Stone is permanent, no-maintenance hardscape** -- once properly installed with edging and weed barrier, stone pathways and beds require essentially zero upkeep
4. **Match stone to context** -- jagged stone for walking, round stone for decorating; never use round rock on pathways
5. **Grade changes are opportunities** -- use boulder retaining walls to create raised beds, improve drainage, and add visual depth with just 6 inches of elevation
6. **Create outdoor rooms** -- fire pit, water feature, seating surrounded by landscape; pull living spaces INTO the garden
7. **Light the plants, not the ground** -- avoid runway path lights; use spotlights on trees and wall lights on low plants for resort-quality ambiance
8. **Boulders are the lowest-maintenance element** -- zero care, add texture change, give the eye a place to rest; don't be afraid to incorporate them
9. **Weed barrier under all stone** -- commercial weed barrier fabric is the foundation of every stone bed and pathway
10. **Phase your hardscape** -- start with stone pathway, add flagstone later, add boulders as budget allows; the designer built her own garden in phases over years
