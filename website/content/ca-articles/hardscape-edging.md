## 1. Why Edging Matters

John Valentino considers edging one of the single most impactful upgrades for any landscape:

> "Today I will reveal to you one of the important ways to make your garden and lawn look like a thousand bucks and that's proper edging."

A professional edge comes down to exactly two things -- **shape** and **grade**:

> "A professional edge appears that way if the shape is very clean and neat and reflects the shape you're after and if the grade is the proper grade in relation to what you're edging."

Edging also serves a critical maintenance function, containing invasive lawns like Bermuda:

> "If you have a lawn, let's contain that lawn so that it doesn't become a weed and grow outside the desired area... The other neat thing I like about proper edging is you maintain a certain shape to it and you maintain certain lines which you probably spent a lot of time coming up with when you designed the garden."

## 2. Edging Systems Comparison

### Overview Table

| System | Approx. Cost | DIY-Friendly? | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shovel cut** | Free | Yes | Loses shape over time; adequate where budget is zero |
| **Plastic edging** | Cheapest | Yes | **Not recommended** -- warps in heat/cold, poor durability |
| **Permalock anodized aluminum** | ~$6 / linear ft | Yes | Holds shape indefinitely; bends for curves; 16 ft lengths |
| **Steel edging (3/16" w/ welded rebar)** | ~$3--4 / linear ft (material) | No (contractor) | Most durable; more labor; can double as small retaining wall |
| **Concrete mow strip (6")** | $20--25 / linear ft | No (contractor) | Most visually evident; best Bermuda barrier |
| **Brick edging** | More than concrete | No (contractor) | Most expensive option |

### 2a. Plastic Edging -- Why to Avoid It

John is emphatic across multiple videos:

> "Plastic edging. At first blush, and on paper, it's great. It's cheap, and it seems to do the job, but it does many things poorly."

> "Hot weather makes it contract and expand in ways that don't allow it to stay in place. It doesn't like cold weather either. Warming and cooling in general makes the plastic edging not hold its shape and its form and its grade properly."

> "It's not durable in terms of being hit. Edging you'll have to assume is going to get hit with a blade or a weed eater or something because it's edging. So you add it all up and you've got a cheap material that performs cheaply and not effectively."

> "Don't use cheap plastic edging. It doesn't hold its shape well. Even though it's cheaper, it's not worth it in the long run. It produces an inferior look and an inferior product."

The verdict: you may save upfront, but you will spend more replacing it:

> "You might save money up front, but in the end, you'll need to replace it if you want it to look good and you want it to function properly. And so in replacing it, you'll spend quite a bit more money."

---

### 2b. Permalock Anodized Aluminum (~$6/linear ft)

John's top recommendation for homeowners:

> "This is one of the most useful and professional looking edges that's really easy to install. Permalock edging. This is just a piece of it. It comes in 16 ft lengths with the stakes. It bends easily... you can bend into free form curve linear shapes or you can keep it straight. They call it anodized aluminum. I think it's actually just painted."

Pricing:

> "Our price for Permalock edging is right up there around $6 a linear foot. It's not inexpensive, but it's a very good product, works very well, and lasts indefinitely."

It can be added retroactively:

> "With Permalock edging, you can put it in anytime when you do your original installation or you can come back after your landscape is complete. You know, you might have to do a little mini excavation, but nothing major."

A real-world example of Permalock outlasting cheap alternatives:

> "Since we had a lot of curves we used product called Permalock, very nice edging and good for homeowners to install, and a lot of edging that you can find at places like Home Depot and stuff isn't good when you have freezing and hot weather -- you'll see heave and move -- and this edging stays put. As you can see it's stayed, you know, it's right in the same grade as when we installed it."

---

### 2c. Steel Edging -- 3/16" with Welded Rebar (~$3--4/linear ft material)

The contractor-grade workhorse:

> "The other type of edging that we use a lot of on a lot of the projects we do, and so it's more contractor oriented, is just real steel about a 3/16 thickness. We weld the rebar to the edging in order to shape it."

Cost comparison with Permalock:

> "Both of these are similar in cost. I think the steel edge is less expensive than the Permalock, but then there is more labor in it. So, if you're at $6 with this, you're probably buying this for about three or $4 a linear foot."

Steel edging separating materials:

> "Here, we've used the steel edging. We've used it to separate this rock area, which is for parking, with a planting area, which has mulch. We're just a little above the rock, and then we're more above the bark. We hope that the rock doesn't get into the bark, and the bark doesn't get into the rock."

Steel edging can also serve as a mini retaining wall:

> "There is a slope to the backyard. In order to make that slope less we're using some steel edging as a little retaining wall. We're going to paint that steel edging dragon breath so that it looks similar to the wall behind it which is made out of concrete block."

Long-term pathway durability:

> "This path which has a nice steel edging on either side, you can see it's holding up very well by kind of impregnating stone into decomposed granite."

---

### 2d. Concrete Mow Strips ($20--25/linear ft)

> "Concrete is used a lot as an edge on lawns, but it's also the most expensive and the most visually evident. A six-inch mow strip is going to cost 20 to $25 a linear foot."

Concrete is appropriate when you need a physical barrier against invasive Bermuda grass, but it is a significant investment and cannot be easily repositioned.

---

### 2e. Brick Edging (Most Expensive)

> "And then all other types of masonry can be used, too. You could use brick, and brick's going to be even more expensive than concrete."

---

### Cost Comparison Summary

| Edging Type | Material Cost (per linear ft) | Installed Cost Estimate | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plastic | <$1 | <$2 | **Not recommended** |
| Permalock aluminum | ~$6 (incl. stakes) | ~$6 (DIY) | Curves, retrofits, homeowner install |
| Steel (3/16") | $3--4 | $6+ (with labor/welding) | Contractor projects, long runs, retaining |
| Concrete mow strip | -- | $20--25 | Bermuda containment, formal lawns |
| Brick | -- | >$25 | High-end formal landscapes |

---

## 3. Proper Grading

Getting the grade right is one of the two critical factors (along with shape). The edging must be high enough to contain material but low enough to be unobtrusive:

> "You have to be pretty precise about the top of the grade of the edging because it has to be high enough that it does its job and keeps the material separate and yet low enough that it's not a hazard or a visual hazard."

### Grading Rules

| Adjacent Material | Edging Height Above Material |
|---|---|
| Lawn | ~1/4 inch above |
| Rock / Gravel | ~3/4 inch above |

> "So the height of edging is just a little above whatever you're controlling. In the case of lawn, maybe like a quarter of an inch above the lawn. If it's gravel, maybe more like 3/4 of an inch above the gravel."

Specific Permalock lawn-edge example:

> "So this is the Permalock edging as a lawn edge where we're just barely above the height of the lawn and about 3/4 of an inch above the rock. We're keeping the rock separate from the lawn."

---

## 4. Shape Considerations

John consistently advocates simplicity over complexity:

> "We like very simple shapes, direct shapes, sometimes straight lines, sometimes curved linear lines, but always the simplest shape to accomplish our goals."

> "A straight line or very direct practical lines are better than saying, 'Well, I need to be creative here, so I'm going to have this wrap around here and have this curly queue.' And you know, that's not really creativity."

On circulation / walkway layout:

> "The idea of setting up your circulation, so your walkways, your pathways based on use. I'm really fond of that idea that instead of racking your brain trying to be creative, let's rack our brains trying to be practical and functional and within that if we stick to bold lines, it can look extremely professional and be very useful at the same time."

> "Whichever you choose, let's be direct. Let's be bold. Let's be simple about it. There's nothing wrong with straight lines."

The college campus principle -- let use define the path:

> "Instead of putting in the circulation right away they allowed the students to establish the circulation where they could see the patterns that were being used because these were the best fastest ways to get where people needed to get and then build the circulation around that using either straight lines or broad-spreading curve linear lines."

The most common edging mistake is a shape problem:

> "When you use these edging products, you are forever defining the shape of whatever it is you're defining. You need to make sure you get that shape to be exactly what you want. The most common is the use of inexpensive materials that don't hold up well and can't maintain their grade and so they don't hold their shape well."

## 5. Pathway Materials & Construction

### Gravel Pathway (the go-to method)

John builds pathways the same way across many projects -- a layered system:

> "Circulation is one way to make your landscape look a lot more opulent. Easy to do and not expensive, especially if you use some of these ideas that we use, such as a gravel path with edging that is really good for the do-it-yourselfer."

#### Construction Layers (bottom to top)

| Layer | Material | Thickness | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (optional) | Base rock | 1--2 inches | For higher-traffic areas |
| 2 | Decomposed granite (DG) | 1.5--3 inches | Compacted; provides firm base |
| 3 | Decorative gravel | Thin layer | Pressed into DG with vibratory compactor |
| 4 | Edging (both sides) | -- | Permalock or steel to contain materials |

Detailed build description:

> "This path we put in our edging, which we used Permalock in this case, and it's very easy to install. We only did about an inch or two of base rock. Then we did about inch and a half, 2 inches of decomposed granite. We compacted it. This rock is a 3/4 inch called Yuma. We put it on top of the DG and we used a vibratory compactor. We kind of set the rock in the DG so that it doesn't move around a lot and then use the edging to contain it so it doesn't go into the other rock. Relatively inexpensive to install, easy to maintain."

Alternative using just DG and gravel (lighter traffic):

> "Sometimes if it's just pedestrian and minor traffic, we might just use decomposed granite for 2 to 3 inches. And then we use a thin layer of some type of attractive looking gravel. Could be 3/8 inch gravel. It could be 3/4 inch gravel. And we put that right on top of the DG. And then we use a vibratory compactor and we press it into the decomposed granite."

Why not just DG alone -- a cautionary example:

> "We just used DG because that's what the homeowners thought they wanted and they started having problems with just the plain DG. For one thing, it tracked and every time it got wet and they drove over it, they essentially removed some of the DG on their tires and so it got to be less and less and then water from rain and from sprinklers came into the equation and went into low spots and made kind of a muddy mess."

The fix: gravel on top of DG:

> "We took that DG that was there, we leveled it out and we put on top of it 3/4 inch gravel called Sierra. And it has worked fantastic. Now it's a clean, permanent paving, very inexpensive."

### Pea Gravel Surface

For service yards and utilitarian areas:

> "A surface made out of anodized aluminum edging and pea gravel on top of decomposed granite makes a very inexpensive durable clean surface. You could use just a decomposed granite. The nice thing about putting the pea gravel on top or some type of gravel is it makes it a little cleaner where it doesn't track. We don't put a thick layer of the pea gravel and that way it's not real squishy -- instead it's firm, almost like a paving surface."

## 6. Rock Types & Their Uses

### Quick Reference Table

| Rock Type | Size | Primary Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **California Gold DG** | Fine (sand-like) | Pathway base, ground cover, rock bands | Golden color; common in Central CA |
| **California Gold gravel** | 3/8 inch | Walking paths, rock bands for visual movement | Bright golden hue |
| **Yuma rock** | 3/4 inch | Pathway top layer, general ground cover | Pressed into DG for stability |
| **Rainbow rock** | 3/4 inch+ | Mulch replacement, dog-friendly yards | Multi-colored; attractive |
| **Sierra gravel** | 3/4 inch | Driveway overlay, pathway repair | Fix for DG-only surfaces |
| **Noa pebbles** | 4--8 inches | Accent/feature areas, dry creek aesthetic | Set into DG |
| **Mexican cobble** | Small--medium | Accent strips, wave patterns, formal features | Dark grayish-black; hand-placed into DG |

### California Gold (DG and Gravel)

Used extensively for pathways and to create visual movement:

> "We used a 3/8 inch California gold rock and put it over just a little, probably a half inch of decomposed granite."

> "California gold -- I think we used decomposed granite first and then we compacted California gold into it so it's firm."

Walking paths refreshed over time:

> "We have these walking paths made out of 3/8 inch gravel, this is called California gold, and it has edging. We just spruced that up a little with a little bit of gravel on top because over the years it starts looking a little bit dingy."

### Yuma Rock

The preferred pathway surface rock:

> "This rock is a 3/4 inch called Yuma. We put it on top of the DG and we used a vibratory compactor."

> "We've got base rock and decomposed granite under this Yuma rock. And then we used the Permalock edging to define it and to keep the California gold separated from the Yuma rock."

### Rainbow Rock

A versatile mulch-replacement rock:

> "There's lots of different rocks available. This is an attractive one called Rainbow. And we used it everywhere we could use it. And we didn't put it real thick because if you don't put it real thick, I think it's good for soil, good for the plants under the rock."

For dog-friendly yards, size matters:

> "One thing that's important there is to make those rocks big enough. There's a lot of gravel or rock being used in landscapes that's 3/8 and they still tend to dig in that. But if you can make it 3/4 and bigger, that seems to not prohibit them but discourage them from digging in it."

### Mexican Cobble

Hand-placed accent material:

> "We used this nice look of Mexican cobble. We hand placed them into decomposed granite."

> "That little strip of Mexican cobble placed in decomposed granite adds a nice feature."

Creating contrast and interest near the house:

> "We used two types of rock. One is 4 to 8 inch Noa pebbles. We also used Mexican cobble. They're smaller. They're dark grayish blackish for this interesting contrast in cobble and a kind of a wave that runs through it."

## 7. Rock Bands for Visual Movement

One of the more creative techniques John describes -- using bands of rock defined by edging to suggest motion:

> "This is an interesting landscape that the owner helped us design. And she had what turned out to be this great idea. We used edging to define these ground cover areas. And then next to the ground cover areas, she wanted to suggest movement. And it was a little hard to picture when she was describing it, but as we laid it out over time, it has become more and more evident that it works. You get this sense of movement and motion without anything moving."

The construction method:

> "And so we used edging and then we used a 3/8 inch California gold rock and put it over just a little, probably a half inch of decomposed granite. And you can see that it's very effective."

The same technique at another project:

> "Her idea was to try to create movement... I was a little unsure it would be successful but it really is successful. Just 2 or 3 inches of compacted California gold -- I think we used decomposed granite first and then we compacted California gold into it so it's firm."

---

## 8. Boulder Placement

John draws from natural principles when placing boulders:

> "There was a big trend some years back where everyone thought they had to have boulders. And there still are appropriate places to use settings of boulders, especially if you're trying to create a natural type landscape with mounds."

### Boulder Placement Rules

| Principle | Guideline |
|---|---|
| **Grouping** | Odd numbers -- threes and fives |
| **Spacing** | "Not put two rocks right next to each other" |
| **Burial depth** | "About one-third buried. So it looks like it's coming out of the soil, not laying on top of the soil" |
| **Shape variety** | "One flat rock, one rounded rock that's a little taller and maybe one upright rock" |

Full quote on natural-looking settings:

> "Since we're trying to remind ourselves of nature, I think when you set boulders, you should use principles from nature. And those would be to do the settings in odd numbers of threes and fives. Not put two rocks right next to each other. Whatever the size and shape of the boulder, it should be about one-third buried. So it looks like it's coming out of the soil, not laying on top of the soil. And the other thing is use settings that have a variety of boulder shapes. So, like if you're going to use a grouping of three, you could put one flat rock, one rounded rock that's a little taller and maybe one upright rock. Those make interesting and very natural looking settings, especially when they're buried appropriately."

## 9. Rock as Mulch -- Best Practices

Rock can replace wood mulch in certain areas, but there are rules:

> "Something that any person with a yard should prioritize and that is protecting the soil... there is another option and that is rock products. And the rock products come in many different sizes and colors. And they also protect the soil if you do it properly and amend the soil properly before and after."

Key guidelines:
- **Keep it thin**: "Not to make it real thick... It can be just an inch thick."
- **Don't pile around plant bases**: "You don't want to pile the rocks up around the base of the plants."
- **Mix materials**: "I don't mean to infer that if you're going to use rock, it has to all be rock. I think it's an interesting look to have certain areas where you think wood mulch would be better."
- **No landscape fabric under plants**: "I would encourage you not to use landscape fabric where you are using plants... many times the landscape fabric over time gets plugged up with roots. We like to relegate the use of landscape fabric to only places without plants."

## 10. Key Takeaways

1. **Never use plastic edging** -- it warps, shifts, and looks bad over time.
2. **Permalock aluminum** is the best DIY option at ~$6/ft; steel at ~$3--4/ft material is the contractor standard.
3. **Grade edging precisely**: 1/4" above lawn, 3/4" above rock/gravel.
4. **Keep shapes simple and direct** -- bold lines over decorative squiggles.
5. **Layer pathways**: base rock (optional) + compacted DG + decorative gravel + edging.
6. **Never use DG alone** for driveways or high-traffic areas -- always top with gravel.
7. **Bury boulders one-third** in groups of odd numbers with varied shapes.
8. **Rock bands** defined by edging create a sense of movement without moving parts.
9. **Rock mulch** should be thin (~1 inch) with no landscape fabric where plants grow.
