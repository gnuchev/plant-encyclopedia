## Why Mediterranean/Drought-Tolerant Matters in Zone 9 California {#why-it-matters}

Central California -- Fresno and the San Joaquin Valley in particular -- has a hot, dry Mediterranean climate with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit and chronic drought conditions. As John Valentino puts it:

> "We interpret zeroscape to mean a dry landscape that doesn't necessarily look dry. We want it to look attractive, not just like a bunch of cactus and a bunch of rock. And there are a lot of plants that you can pick that bloom, hardly require any water, but create something that doesn't look too zeroscapy."

The case for converting to drought-tolerant landscaping is compelling:

- **Water conservation is essential.** Valentino notes: "In a drought area where we are... there's not a lot of water to waste." A homeowner describes: "Frankly during the summer it seemed horribly wasteful to be watering it all the time."
- **Reduced maintenance costs.** Converting from lawn eliminates constant sprinkler repair: "Honest, I was out here every week fixing a sprinkler. It was just a time-consuming challenge to keep this part of the lawn looking good."
- **Lower water bills.** Drip irrigation in drought-tolerant gardens delivers water only where needed: "Big maintenance saving because you're not throwing water everywhere."
- **Increased home value.** Well-landscaped drought-tolerant gardens improve curb appeal while being responsible: "If someone wanted to redo their lawn, make it drought tolerant and beautiful at the same time, we would wholeheartedly advise them to do so."

### The Mediterranean Climate Advantage

Zone 9 California shares its climate profile with the Mediterranean basin, parts of Australia, South Africa, and Chile. This opens a huge plant palette:

> "There's other plants from other parts of the world that also do good in a hot dry Mediterranean climate. I like to use all of those together rather than saying I'm only going to use California natives. Olive trees and rosemary and a whole host of other plants that grow in Mediterranean climates which means they don't get summer water and many of them are perfectly suited to our climate here in California. So I kind of mix California natives for our area with exotic plants that have similar requirements because they come from parts of the world with similar climates." -- John Valentino

## Key Drought-Tolerant Plants {#key-plants}

### Trees

#### Fruitless Olives (Olea europaea -- fruitless cultivars)

The signature tree of Valentino's drought-tolerant designs. Used repeatedly across projects as the backbone structural element.

> "The whole theme of this is to have these olives kind of like an overhead... fruitless olives and they've put on a lot of growth since we planted them."

> "The plant pallet here is the olives -- in this case we used just four fruitless olives in a multi fashion, so very low maintenance, appropriate for this small garden, not going to get too big and not going to envelop the house and overpower anything, not going to crack sidewalk."

**Key characteristics:**
- Multi-trunk form creates rustic, aged appearance
- Can be thinned/pruned to create a canopy you walk under
- Appropriate for small lots (won't damage sidewalks)
- Very low water use once established
- One project featured mature transplanted olives that looked "like it's been there about 50, 60 years"

**Dwarf Olive -- 'Little Ollie':**
> "Little Ollie, which is a dwarf olive with no olives, we'll get four, five, 6 feet tall." Used as an informal screening hedge in xeriscape gardens.

#### California Sycamore (Platanus racemosa)

A true California native used in native-style plantings.

> "Platanus racemosa is California Sycamore... they lined their driveway with them."

Used along the San Joaquin River in native habitat areas alongside oaks. Valentino planted 24-inch box specimens to replace failed trees, breaking through hardpan soil with a mini excavator and amending heavily with soil biology products.

#### Smoke Bush (Cotinus -- dwarf cultivar)

Used in courtyard plantings within xeriscape gardens:

> "The smoke bush which is the dwarf smoke bush" -- placed in interior courtyard areas alongside Japanese maples, Eastern redbud, and lamb's ear as a focal point.

#### Other Recommended Drought-Tolerant Trees

| Tree | Size | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Western Redbud (Cercis occidentalis) | Large shrub / small tree | "Native to right where we are, central part of California. It grows in foothill areas and grows in hot dry areas like ours." |
| Eastern Redbud (Cercis) | Small deciduous tree | "Small deciduous trees or large deciduous shrubs -- lots of appropriate applications for them in gardens." |
| Keith Davey Chinese Pistache | Medium shade tree | Grafted (no berries), spectacular fall color. Used for shading south-facing houses. |
| Crape Myrtle (Natchez, multi-trunk) | Small to medium | Low water, great summer bloom. Multiple varieties used. |
| Ginkgo (dwarf varieties) | Small to medium | Used along streets and as specimen trees. |

### Shrubs

#### Rosemary Varieties

A workhorse Mediterranean shrub that doubles as a culinary herb.

**Tuscan Blue Rosemary** (upright form):
> "Tuscan blue rosemary is a good plant for around your house that doesn't get too huge. It's probably 4 feet tall, 3 feet wide. Easy to grow, tough, water efficient, and great for cooking. I can smell it already. If you use it in the right spot, you almost never have to prune it."

> "Rosemary Tuscan blue -- that's an upright version of rosemary. You know, rosemary prostratus grows along the ground."

**Rosemary prostratus** (prostrate/trailing form): Low-growing, used along walls and as ground cover.

**General rosemary care:**
> "Things like oregano and rosemary are very water efficient, you know, Mediterranean type plants."

> "Things like rosemary that get woody, you can prune out dead wood... their fragrance and their flavor maximizes around the first bloom."

#### Salvia Varieties

One of Valentino's most-used drought-tolerant flowering shrubs.

**Santa Barbara Salvia** (dwarf):
> "It's a dwarf salvia... It doesn't get too big and it blooms like crazy more than once a year. That's what's neat about it. So it'll do the same thing -- maybe even a little more profuse in the spring and then it has a long spring where it blooms great. But then when you get into the middle of the summer, it doesn't bloom much. And then as soon as the summer just starts cooling a little, even in August, it starts blooming again right through the fall up into winter."

**Salvia greggii 'Mirage Blue':**
> "This one is called Mirage blue and it's Salvia greggii Mirage blue and it does better than most salvias I plant in that the leaves stay lush, it doesn't get real big, it stays low, blooms like crazy all the time except in the middle of the winter, and has a really nice looking vivid bloom where some of them are more dreary in their bloom."

**Salvia leucantha** (Mexican Bush Sage) and **Salvia greggii**: Used repeatedly in mass plantings alongside lantana and hesperaloe as the core drought-tolerant plant palette.

#### Coprosma / Kopia (Ground Cover Shrub)

A standout performer in Valentino's xeriscape designs, used as a lawn replacement:

> "This kopia was all a Bermuda lawn and so we had the challenge of making sure all the Bermuda was gone and this has done very well."

> "This stand of kopia is in Fresno -- it tends to sometimes get a little more off color than this in the winter, it stays green but sometimes not this green."

> "Kopia really looks great in here... we just have a little drip line with the emitters built into the drip line watering the kopia."

Planted on 3-foot centers in late February, with bands of rock (California Gold) creating visual "movement" through the planting.

#### Other Key Drought-Tolerant Shrubs

| Shrub | Water Needs | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Russelia 'St. Elmo's Fire' | Very low | "Blooms like crazy this time of year... there's not many plants that look its best when it's 105 like it's going to be today here in Fresno. Doesn't hardly take any water." Gets 4-5 feet tall. |
| White Lantana | Low | Mass planted for screening. Cut back annually. Very drought tolerant once established. |
| Red Hesperaloe (Red Yucca) | Very low | Used repeatedly alongside salvia and lantana in xeriscape plantings. |
| Little John Bottlebrush | Low | Used as informal hedging: "Little John bottlebrush which we used as an informal hedge." |
| Bougainvillea (including 'Bambino') | Low | "Got bougainvillea spotted throughout the landscape." Frost-sensitive; goes dormant briefly in winter. |
| Butterfly Bush | Low | Planted among cobble at entries. "A riot of color back in August." |
| Nandina (dwarf varieties -- 'Flirt', 'Blush Pink') | Low-moderate | "You almost never have to prune. Only gets 3 to 4 feet tall." Great fall/spring color. |
| Mexican Bird of Paradise | Low | "Look at this gorgeous plant that blooms with various shades of orange." |

### Perennials

#### Lavender

> "You want to pick plants like lavender that really don't need pruning cuz they don't usually get that big and then you want them to bloom their best."

Best planted in fall in Zone 9 California:
> "Lavender is really good to plant now" (referring to fall planting season).

#### Sea Lavender (Limonium)

Used extensively as a foreground perennial:
> "Some beautiful Nandina blush pink, variegated liriope -- so you can call it statice or you can call it sea lavender."

Combines well with sedum, oak leaf hydrangea, and olive trees in Mediterranean-style plantings.

#### Agave -- Blue Glow and Dwarf Varieties

> "Lots of agave aren't practical and useful in small gardens because they're huge. Whereas Blue Glow stays only two feet tall. And there's other dwarf varieties. Blue Glow is one of my favorites. You can see it has very handsome foliage."

> "Blue glow agave -- a lot of agave would be too big for this site. At seven years old they don't really get any bigger than this, so it's a dwarf agave."

**Container use:** "You can see Eddie's using dwarf agave, not Blue Glow, but a different variety in his pots. They're excellent in pots."

**Feeding:** "Although agave aren't real heavy feeders, what I would do in these pots is... blend. With agave I just do a springtime application."

#### Sedum 'Autumn Joy'

> "Sedum Autumn Joy which is just starting to bloom now and it blooms pretty much right through the summer."

Note: "This sedum... basically dies even in Fresno, dies back to almost nothing in the winter" -- it returns reliably in spring.

---

### Ground Covers

#### Kopia / Coprosma

(See Shrubs section above.) Primary lawn replacement in xeriscape gardens. Planted on 3-foot centers.

#### Juniper 'Procumbens Nana'

> "Juniper procumbens nana doesn't get more than 6 to 12 inches and just grows along the ground. You can use it as a ground cover in the foreground because it's low. It doesn't get big at all. It's tough. It doesn't require much water. It's easy to grow. Doesn't need pruning."

#### Dymondia

Used between pavers and stepping stones in xeriscape gardens as a walkable ground cover.

#### Other Ground Covers

- **Creeping Thyme**: Used under specimen trees, mixed with other low plants
- **Blue Fescue**: Ornamental grass accent in xeriscape plantings
- **Asian Jasmine**: Used in shaded courtyard areas

---

### Native California Plants

Valentino offers critical guidance on selecting native plants:

> "When you look into using natives -- natives all over the country or California natives -- California represents a challenge because there are so many native plants and yet there's a lot of different microclimates in California. So just because it's a California native doesn't mean it would thrive in your area without a lot of care. So you need to figure out which part of California it's native to, and if that's similar to your part of California."

**The Coast Redwood cautionary tale:**
> "A good example of a California native that isn't native to similar areas to our hot dry summers is the Coast Redwood, which occurs in moist summer areas from Santa Cruz northward along the coast where you get summer fog. We have nothing close to summer fog."

**Recommended California natives for Central Valley (hot, dry summers):**

| Native Plant | Type | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Western Redbud (Cercis occidentalis) | Tree/large shrub | "Native to right where we are, central part of California." Spectacular spring bloom even on trunk. |
| California Sycamore (Platanus racemosa) | Large tree | Driveway and riparian plantings |
| Valley Oak / Live Oak | Large tree | Used in native settings |
| Matilija Poppy | Perennial | "Fantastic blooming plant, beautiful native -- easy to kill if you overwater it." |
| Flannel Bush | Shrub | "Easily killed by overwatering." |

## Water-Efficient Garden Design Principles {#design-principles}

### 1. Use a Limited, Repeated Plant Palette

> "What we like to do is not use one plant here and one plant there, but come up with a fairly small plant pallet and then use it in bold ways. When you mass plants, you really are affording yourself a real look into their beauty because when they bloom, they bloom all together and they make quite an impact."

### 2. Allow Plants Their Natural Form

> "A useful important garden in my mind is, if you want to minimize maintenance, to do it with plants that you can allow to grow to their natural forms and you don't have to be clubbing them into submission."

> "In order to allow plants to just grow without controlling pruning, you need to be very conscious of not picking things that get too big for the garden."

### 3. Design for People, Not Just Appearance

> "Gardens are for people. Let's make it more than just landscaping to look at from the street. Let's make it a garden we can walk through, a garden we can sit in and talk with neighbors."

Valentino creates pathways, seating areas, and courtyards within xeriscape gardens. One homeowner shared:
> "We really wanted to traverse the yard within the yard and lead people from one place to another... it invites you to take a look and go through it almost like a magical journey."

### 4. Use Hardscape Strategically

- **Decomposed granite (DG):** Compacted base for pathways. Inexpensive, easy to maintain.
- **3/4-inch rock (e.g., Yuma):** Set on DG and compacted with a vibratory compactor.
- **Mexican Cobble:** Set on DG with sand between; provides bold texture contrast.
- **Poured concrete stepping stones:** Break up large areas, with kopia planted between them.
- **California Gold gravel (3/8-inch):** Used in parking strips and pathways for color contrast.

### 5. Zone Your Planting by Water Needs

> "An idea that I like even in xeriscape gardens -- in the entries and in close-up areas you can have plants that require more water and/or lusher. So the idea of the courtyard is it will have things like Japanese maples and Eastern redbud."

**Design zones (from street to interior):**
- **Street-facing / parking strip:** Lowest water -- kopia, gravel, olives, agave
- **Front garden:** Low water -- salvia, lantana, rosemary, hesperaloe, rock mulch
- **Interior courtyard:** Moderate water -- Japanese maple, redbud, lamb's ear, liriope
- **Backyard / patio:** Mix of low and moderate per use

### 6. Layer Heights Front-to-Back

A typical Valentino xeriscape planting, front to back:
1. **Foreground (under 2 ft):** Agave Blue Glow, juniper procumbens nana, sedum, sea lavender
2. **Mid-ground (2-4 ft):** Salvia, lantana, rosemary, nandina, kopia
3. **Background (4-6+ ft):** Russelia St. Elmo's Fire, Little John bottlebrush, privet screen
4. **Canopy:** Fruitless olives (multi-trunk), crape myrtle

## Transitioning from Traditional to Drought-Tolerant Landscape {#transitioning}

### Step 1: Decide to Let Go of the Lawn

One homeowner's journey:
> "I think it was the middle of this past winter when we were only able to water once a week. Why bother? We were just going to have another dead lawn with broken sprinklers this summer. So we turned the water off altogether. And then it became distressingly dead and that pushed us obviously over the edge towards getting it done."

### Step 2: Remove the Lawn and Address Hidden Problems

> "We removed the grass and immediately found a big issue which is we think a reason the grass struggled. Incredible root mass from existing trees."

Surface roots from existing trees can be carefully removed. This is also the time to address soil compaction.

### Step 3: Kill Bermuda Thoroughly

If converting a Bermuda lawn:
> "We killed the Bermuda two or three times and we've pretty much gotten rid of it."

Watch for re-emergence: "This is the Bermuda re-emerging and if you don't do anything about it, it'll re-establish and grow everywhere."

### Step 4: Install Drip Irrigation

> "We had to put in a drip system because that's part of the low water using protocol. With the lawn, they had sprinklers that were throwing water everywhere. We put in a new system that just delivers water to each plant."

### Step 5: Amend the Soil

> "It's real important with a zeroscape garden to maximize the health of your soil because that will minimize the amount of water that you need and that's the whole point of a zeroscape garden, and it will maximize bloom and vitality."

### Step 6: Plant and Mulch

- Use quality edging (permalock recommended over cheap plastic)
- Don't overplant: "Look at what it looked like right after we planted it. You might be tempted to plant more plants because all you saw was rock, but we didn't want a rock garden here. We wanted one featuring really nice plants. So the temptation was let's plant more. Well, we didn't plant more and look at it as it's growing."
- Let plants fill in naturally over months

### Step 7: Gradually Reduce Watering

> "When it's first planted, even a zeroscape or water efficient garden, they have to branch out into the soil. The roots do. So it's difficult to go immediately into water conserving mode. You do much more frequent waterings although it doesn't have to be real deep watering, to just make sure everything survives, takes off, and begins to root down. Now we're into the second year and we can start watering less frequently and more deeply to try to encourage deep rooting."

---

## Irrigation Considerations {#irrigation}

### Drip Is the Standard for Xeriscape

> "When we first bought this property many years ago, it was virtually all sprinklers. And now it is all drip for a number of reasons... we're in an area that gets a lot of drought type weather and we've faced that water shortage here."

**Two types of drip used by Valentino:**

1. **Individual emitters:** For trees, large shrubs, and specimen plants
   > "The plants are either watered with individual emitters..."

2. **Inline drip tubing (emitters built in):** For ground cover areas
   > "...or we have the rows of tubing with the emitters built in where we want ground cover to fill in."

### Watering Frequency by Establishment Phase

| Phase | Frequency | Depth | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Just planted (summer, 100+ degrees) | Daily | Shallow | Until roots establish |
| First few weeks | Every other day | Moderate | Gradually tapering |
| First year | 2-3 times per week | Moderate-deep | Encouraging root growth |
| Second year onward | Once a week or less | Deep, infrequent | "Water as little as possible and have everything look like it doesn't need watering" |
| Fully established (2+ years) | Minimal to none | Deep when applied | "Water efficient plants -- after a couple of years you might even be able to turn off the irrigation system" |

### Establishing Natives in Hot Areas

For native plantings in areas with 100-degree summer days:

> "To establish new plantings in an area like Fresno that has lots of 100 degree days in the summer, the best way to do it is to be able to provide some watering the first two years or so and that'll get them off to a really strong start."

### Avoid Drip Tubing in Wild/Natural Areas

> "I don't like to use drip tubing because it's really subject to animals eating it and putting holes in it and constantly needing repair. What we came up with is all the pipe is buried and it's all schedule 40 pipe and then when we got to each plant we put it on a regular sprinkler that pops up 4 inches when it comes on."

### When to Water

> "The perfect time to water is very early in the morning, right before the sun comes out, and then finish the watering as the sun's coming out. And the thinking there is we're applying water, there's no evaporation due to sun and stuff while we're applying it. So that gives it the greatest chance to soak into the soil."

---

## Rock and Mulch for Moisture Retention {#rock-and-mulch}

### Mulch Benefits

Valentino is a strong advocate of mulch (2-3 inches):

> "It is great at retaining moisture and making it so you have to water a lot less."

> "It helps during the winter... keeping the soil a little warmer and reasonable temperature, especially for tropical and subtropical plants. The other thing about the mulch -- in the summer gets up in 100 degree weather. By having that mulch, it helps to keep the soil a little cooler and it also stops the water from evaporating. So we don't have to water as much, which in a drought area, that's very beneficial."

**Recommended mulch types:**

| Mulch Type | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| Double-ground shredded cedar | Stays put, resists blowing, "kind of cements together" | More expensive |
| Walk-on bark (Supreme) | Attractive dark color, moderate weight | Can be displaced |
| Black Forest humus | Very attractive, dark | "Doesn't stay put" -- easily blown by leaf blowers |

### Rock as Ground Cover

Rock is increasingly popular for the Mediterranean look:

> "Some people associate it with kind of a Mediterranean maybe slash native plant look where the plants are a little sparer and don't use a lot of water and rock is the ground cover."

**Rock types used:**
- **Desert Gold Rock:** Bold texture for planting areas
- **3/4-inch Rainbow Rock:** Discourages dog digging, attractive
- **Mexican Cobble:** Hand-placed on DG for entries and patios
- **California Gold (3/8-inch gravel):** Pathways and parking strips

**Caution about landscape fabric under rock:**
> "Over time a landscape fabric or people call it a weed fabric can inhibit the effectiveness of our product because it'll get kind of clogged with silt and sometimes roots and so we don't have that ability for the product to go right through the rock."

### Rock Considerations with Plants

> "Put in some more hearty drought tolerant plants which could take the reflection off the rocks from the hot sun. And that's a consideration that only in recently have I discovered can make a difference with some plants."

Heat reflection from rock can stress some plants -- choose appropriately tough species for rock-mulched areas.

---

## Soil Health Approach to Drought Tolerance {#soil-health}

This is a central tenet of Valentino's approach -- healthy, biologically active soil retains moisture better, reducing water needs.

### The Core Principle

> "The number one thing you need to grow a beautiful garden is healthy soil. That's what allows your jasmine and cape honeysuckle and your photinia and your hibiscus to thrive and bloom properly and not have pest and disease."

> "The more work you do on your soil in terms of building it full of life, the less you will need to use inputs like organic fertilizer, any kind of fertilizer because the soil will be producing its own nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium."

### How Soil Biology Reduces Water Needs

> "If our soil has all kinds of microbiology in it, that's a part of being able to water less."

> "The combination starts microbiological growth which is important for the general health of plants, also important for gardens that you want to be able to use water as efficiently as possible."

### The Native Plant Community Model

> "I don't know if you've been to a native plant community, let's say like a redwood forest. Why is it in a redwood forest everything looks healthy? There's no aphids. Nobody's putting on any types of pesticides or fungicides. It's a self-sustaining plant community because the soil is being fed by the native plant community and that soil is rich and that soil is full of life -- beneficial bacteria, fungi, good protozoa, good nematodes -- and that's what we're after in our gardens."

### Soil Amendment Protocol for Xeriscape Installation

1. **At planting:** Heavy application of soil biology products (approximately 20 lbs per 1,000 sq ft of blend)
2. **Liquid bio-tiller:** Sprayed on during planting process -- "kind of like a liquid organic matter"
3. **Ongoing maintenance:** Every 6 months to 1 year, reapply amendments
4. **For natives:** Avoid synthetic fertilizers -- "One of the worst things for natives... products that are focused more on feeding the soil and then the soil feeds the plant rather than artificially providing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium in a way that can be harsh and bad for natives."

### Sandy Soil

> "There's nothing better for sandy soil than to infuse it with life. So, beneficial microbiology of all kinds."

### Succulents

> "Succulents are kind of a whole different world in that they don't like synthetic fertilizer and they don't like dramatic boosts. They like very subtle boost. So we're going to use products that focus on the soil rather than products that try to feed those succulents directly. And that's the best way to treat succulents."

---

## Seasonal Care for Drought-Tolerant Gardens {#seasonal-care}

### Spring (February - April)

- **Best time for spring feeding:** Apply soil amendments (blend) around root zones of olives, shrubs, and perennials
- **Monitor kopia and ground covers** -- they begin greening up significantly in March/April
  > "The owner was saying the yard is a lot more lush and attractive in about April."
- **Salvia begins its first bloom cycle** -- profuse spring flowering
- **Sedum re-emerges** from winter dormancy
- **Plant natives now** -- Western redbud blooms spectacularly: "We're kind of picturing them blooming in the spring which will be spectacular."
- **Plant lavender** if not done in fall

### Summer (May - September)

- **Reduce watering frequency** for established plants -- deep and infrequent
- **Monitor for heat stress** in rock-mulched areas (reflected heat)
- **Russelia St. Elmo's Fire peaks** -- one of few plants that looks its best at 105 degrees
- **Santa Barbara Salvia** goes quiet mid-summer, then re-blooms in August
- **Lantana, bougainvillea** bloom vigorously
- **Prune lightly if needed** -- "Even though it's over 100 degrees today, there's nothing wrong with pruning when it's hot. As long as you don't prune excessively."
- **Add annuals** like zinnias ("fast-growing, drought tolerant, and easy maintenance flowers") for summer color

### Fall (October - November)

- **Plant lavender and other Mediterranean perennials** -- "Lavender is really good to plant now" (fall)
- **Salvia re-blooms** through fall into winter
- **Nandina shows excellent fall color**
- **Chinese pistache** provides spectacular fall color
- **Reduce irrigation further** as temperatures cool
- **Good time to plant natives** -- gives them winter rain for establishment

### Winter (December - January)

- **Some dormancy is normal:**
  - Russelia St. Elmo's Fire: "They look a little half dormant now because they do get half dormant when you have cold weather."
  - Sedum: Dies back to almost nothing
  - Kopia: May lose some color but stays green
  - Bougainvillea: Frost damage at 32 degrees, recovers quickly in spring
- **Protect frost-sensitive plants** -- move potted dwarf olives to greenhouse if possible
- **Minimal to no irrigation** -- let winter rain do the work
- **Apply soil amendments** -- "Rain will incorporate this better than anything else"
- **Plan and design** for spring planting

## Common Mistakes {#common-mistakes}

### 1. Overwatering Drought-Tolerant and Native Plants

This is the number one killer:

> "One of the worst things for natives, since you're selecting them usually for their ability to get along without a lot of water, one of the worst things is to water them a lot, especially in heavy clay-like soil."

> "If you plant them near lawns, that's usually not going to work. There's a lot of California natives -- flannel bush -- that are easily killed by overwatering. Matilija poppy, fantastic blooming plant, beautiful native -- easy to kill if you overwater it."

> "Nothing can kill a plant faster than too much water."

### 2. Planting Water-Thirsty Species in a Xeriscape

> "The whole point of a zeroscape garden is not to plant things that require a lot of water. Don't plant redwood trees. They need a lot of water in the summer. Don't plant weeping willows. That's the most water thirsty tree you could plant. So don't use inappropriate plants."

### 3. Choosing the Wrong Native

> "Just because it's a California native doesn't mean it would thrive in your area without a lot of care. So you need to figure out which part of California it's native to."

### 4. Overplanting

> "Don't overplant the garden. And don't use plants that dominate the garden because of their massive size. You know, if you're planting a zeroscape garden, I don't think for the most part it should be things you have to prune and make into shapes. We want them to be their natural form."

> "You might be tempted to plant more plants because all you saw was rock... Well, we didn't plant more and look at it as it's growing. And this is just after a few months. Let them grow. Let them attain their natural form."

### 5. Keeping Old Sprinkler Systems

> "Don't keep your same sprinkler system that threw water everywhere on your lawn. Instead, use something water efficient that delivers water directly to the plant."

### 6. Using Cheap Edging

> "Don't use cheap plastic edging. It doesn't hold its shape well. Even though it's cheaper, it's not worth it in the long run."

### 7. Expecting Instant Results

> "When it's first planted even a zeroscape or water efficient garden, they have to branch out into the soil. The roots do. So it's difficult to go immediately into water conserving mode."

### 8. Neglecting Soil Health

> "It's real important with a zeroscape garden to maximize the health of your soil because that will minimize the amount of water that you need."

### 9. Not Choosing the Right Plant for Sun Exposure

Valentino learned this through trial: Japanese grass planted in too much sun failed and had to be replaced with dianella, which tolerates both sun and shade. Heat reflection from rock and cobble is an additional factor to consider.

### 10. Planting Near Lawns

Mixing drought-tolerant natives or Mediterranean plants in the same irrigation zone as lawns leads to overwatering and plant death. Keep zones separate.

## Summary: The Valentino Xeriscape Philosophy

John Valentino's approach to drought-tolerant landscaping in Zone 9 California can be summarized in these principles:

1. **Make it beautiful, not barren.** A xeriscape should look lush and inviting, not like "a bunch of cactus and a bunch of rock."
2. **Build the soil first.** Healthy, biologically active soil retains more moisture and grows stronger plants with less water.
3. **Use a simple, repeated plant palette.** Mass plantings of a few well-chosen species create more impact than scattered individual specimens.
4. **Choose plants that fit.** Right size for the space, right water needs for the zone, right origin for the climate.
5. **Install drip irrigation.** Deliver water directly to each plant; eliminate broadcast sprinklers.
6. **Be patient.** Don't overplant. Let things grow into their natural form. Water more in the first year, then taper dramatically.
7. **Mix Mediterranean plants with appropriate natives.** Olive trees, rosemary, and salvia alongside Western redbud and California sycamore create a rich, adapted palette.
8. **Make it usable.** Paths, seating, courtyards -- gardens are for people.

> "So as you can see, a zeroscape garden doesn't have to look dry or arid. We tried to create something that's even a little bit lush, attractive, and very low water using." -- John Valentino
