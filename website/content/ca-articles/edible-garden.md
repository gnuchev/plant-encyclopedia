## Edible Garden Philosophy in Zone 9

John Valentino's approach to edible gardening centers on a single conviction: soil health is everything. Rather than relying on synthetic fertilizers, the philosophy is to build complex microbiology in the soil -- beneficial bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and good nematodes -- so the soil itself feeds the plants.

> "What if I told you you could eat fresh, inexpensive vegetables from your winter garden if you plant these crops right now?" -- John Valentino

> "Healthy soil is the most important part of a successful vegetable garden -- actually successful flowers and successful plants of all kinds. If you're using soil that has lots of microbiology then you're producing food that's much more nutrient-dense." -- John Valentino

Key principles:

- **Year-round production**: In warm climates like Zone 9, you can plant crops to have something delicious and nutritious to eat all year round by varying planting dates.
- **Soil over fertilizer**: "Fertilizer is for plants. It's not for soil. For soil, we need products that encourage life."
- **Edible integration**: Valentino advocates integrating edible plants into ornamental landscapes rather than isolating them -- using citrus as screening shrubs, bay trees as hedges, and rosemary as ground cover under fruit trees.
- **Stage your harvest**: Plant different varieties that ripen at different times so you are not overwhelmed with one crop all at once.

> "I was pouring water into something I didn't like... I'm really excited now so now I'm going to be watering and I'll pay my water bill and I'll get something back for my water bill." -- Sherry, homeowner converting ornamental yard to edible garden

## Winter / Cool-Season Vegetables

Zone 9 winters are mild enough to grow a remarkable range of cool-season crops. The general rule: plant in late October through November for harvest from December through February (and beyond).

### Onions

**Varieties recommended:**
| Variety | Type | Key Trait |
|---|---|---|
| Walla Walla | Yellow | Very sweet and very mild |
| Elsie | Yellow | Resistant to thrips |
| Sierra Blanca (a.k.a. Superstar) | White | "One of the most widely adaptable onions that grows in lots of different climates" |

**Planting notes:**
- Plant anytime in November (or late October) in Zone 9.
- Other zones: plant in late summer or fall; check specifics for your own zone.
- Allow a few months to harvest.
- Onions do great when planted in the fall.

> "We planted three varieties. Quite a few Walla Walla onions which are very sweet and very mild. And then we planted another yellow one called Elsie. Its claim to fame is that it's resistant to thrips. And then we planted a big white onion. Some people call it Sierra Blanca and some people call it Superstar." -- John Valentino

**Culinary tip from John:** "What I start with to make every dish special is some kind of onion, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. What a great way to start almost any dish."

---

### Broccoli

**Varieties recommended:**

| Variety | Growth Habit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Marathon | Single stalk, big head | Great cold tolerance; standard form |
| Artwork | Broccolini/sprouting type | Side shoots after first harvest; tender and delicious |

**Key details:**
- Grows in zones 2 to 11.
- Likes slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0--7.0).
- Harvest expected mid-to-late December in Zone 9.
- Lasts a long time as long as weather stays cool.

> "This first variety is called Marathon and that grows in the more standard single stalk with big fit of broccoli. It's got great cold tolerance." -- John Valentino

> "Broccoli Artwork... grows like what you would call broccolini as it sprouts and it puts on its first head of broccoli. If you cut that out and harvest it, then it responds with side shoots. Then you're harvesting a much smaller, more tender broccoli." -- John Valentino

**Culinary tip:** "For broccoli, I like it roasted with garlic and maybe lemon. And then what I really like to put over the top is a really good imported Romano cheese."

---

### Cauliflower (Snowball)

- **Variety:** Snowball Cauliflower
- **Size:** 6 inches wide, 3 to 5 lbs each
- **Zones:** 2 to 11
- **Planting in Zone 9:** Plant in fall, even in November; harvest through the winter (December, January, into February)
- **Cool zones (2--6):** Start earlier so you can harvest in the fall
- **Harvest period:** About a two-month period before ready to harvest

> "One of the neat things about Snowball Cauliflower is it stays protected from the sun by the leaves. It can blanch the color. 6 inches wide and 3 to 5 lbs each. That's big. It's almost a quarter of Chip." -- John Valentino

**Culinary tip:** "It really lends itself well to roasting also. It is well enhanced by parsley and dill. And then I love my Romano cheese over the top."

---

### Root Vegetables

#### Detroit Dark Beets

- **Type:** Heirloom (introduced in 1892)
- **Zones:** 2 to 10
- **In zones 2--6:** Grow as a fall or spring crop
- **In Zone 9:** Best as a winter crop
- **Edible parts:** Both the beet itself and the tops

> "These are Detroit Dark Beets. It's an heirloom beet that was introduced in 1892. That's about as heirloom as you can get. They've been around a long time because people like them. And you can eat the beet itself or the tops." -- John Valentino

#### Radishes

- **Zones:** 2 to 11 -- "People all over the country can plant radishes."
- **In Zone 9:** Plant around November; eating radishes by early December
- **Speed:** Harvest in as little as 30 days
- **In cool zones:** Plant in late summer, harvest in fall

> "The neat thing about radishes, which I think makes it useful for growing in a lot of different situations, is how fast you can grow a crop of radishes. I think we can have radishes in 30 days. I don't think you can find another crop that you can grow that fast." -- John Valentino

**Succession planting tip:** "If you plant some radishes every 30 days in relatively warm weather they can germinate and be ready to harvest in 30 days. You wait and plant a few every 30 days, you'll have radishes all the time."

#### Carrots

- Listed alongside celery, kale, and spinach as additional winter crops that "all kind of fall into the same categories as the ones we've described here in terms of the zones they grow in and how you plant them."

---

### Leafy Greens

#### Romaine Lettuce

- **Zones:** 3 to 11
- **Optimal growing temperature:** 45--75 degrees F
- A nutritional powerhouse -- "You could almost consider it a superfood."
- High in vitamins A, C, K, and B6 with lots of minerals and antioxidants
- May be a little more sensitive to cold than the most tolerant winter crops

> "Romaine lettuce is a nutritional powerhouse... High in vitamin A, C, K, and B6 with lots of minerals and lots of antioxidants." -- John Valentino

#### Kale, Spinach, Celery

- Grouped as additional cool-season crops that thrive in Zone 9 winters.
- Same general planting approach as the crops above.
- Can be succession-planted throughout the cool season.

> "There's lots of others you could plant like celery, kale, spinach, carrots, and probably some we're leaving out." -- John Valentino

---

### Broccoli Rabe (Broccoli Rob)

- **Zones:** 3 to 10
- One of John's favorite winter crops
- Easy to grow, wide range of climates
- Bolts (goes to seed) if it gets too warm -- be careful about timing and placement
- Think of it as "a cross between broccoli and mustard greens"
- Very versatile in cooking

> "Broccoli rob is very versatile and you could cook it a lot of different ways. I like it with pasta, but a really creative one is broccoli rob and black bean quesadillas." -- John Valentino

---

## Summer / Warm-Season Vegetables

### Tomatoes

Tomatoes are the centerpiece of the warm-season edible garden in Zone 9. John Valentino has grown tomatoes for over 20 years and has devoted an entire video series ("Growing the World's Biggest Tomato") to the subject.

#### Recommended Varieties

| Variety | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mortgage Lifter | Large heirloom | "Very juicy... has a good texture" -- excellent for slicing and salsa |
| Whopper | Large hybrid | Prolific producer; can be prone to blossom end rot |
| Big Zach | Giant competition type | Known to win "world's biggest tomato" competitions; hard to find as starts (may need to grow from seed) |
| Sun Gold / Sun Sugar | Cherry | "The absolute sweetest tomatoes I've ever tasted" |
| Crimson Caramello | Medium | Grown successfully in Fresno gardens |
| Beef Steak | Large | Classic large tomato |

#### Top 10 Tips for Sweet Tomatoes (John Valentino's List)

1. **#10 -- Pick sweet varieties.** "This is the factor that sets the tone for your whole season of tomato growing." Cherry types (Sun Gold, Sun Sugar) tend to be the sweetest.

2. **#9 -- 6 to 8 hours of full sun.** "Your tomatoes might be getting sun, but do they get enough sun?"

3. **#8 -- Timing is everything.** Plant after the last frost, but as early as possible. "March 15th is considered kind of the magic date" in Fresno/Zone 9. Can plant earlier with frost caps.

4. **#7 -- Improve the texture and tilth of your soil** for excellent drainage. Standing water leads to pests and disease.

5. **#6 -- Maintain consistent but not constant moisture.** "Excess moisture makes more leaf growth and less tomato growth. That upper layer of soil should always be almost dry before you water again. Many people like to water every day. Don't do that."

6. **#5 -- Use sturdy cages or trellises for all-season support.** "If you just shop at a Home Depot, the types of tomato supports they sell aren't adequate and don't work. After about the first month, the tomatoes are knocking over your support." Custom-welded steel cages with lodgepole stakes are recommended.

7. **#4 -- Adequate calcium.** Aim for a 7:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium. Gypsum, lime, or soil sulfur can be used depending on pH. Calcium deficiency (or inability to uptake it) causes blossom end rot.

8. **#3 -- Allow them to ripen on the vine.** Look for full color and a little give when you feel them.

9. **#2 -- Cut back on water as tomatoes approach ripening.** "If you reduce the water uptake, but the plant keeps producing glucose and fructose... then those are more concentrated instead of diluted by water."

10. **#1 -- Infuse your soil with life.** "This is the way to change everything about your soil and create soil that feeds tomatoes and plants in general in a way that allows them to grow the best possible fruit."

#### Staking and Caging

> "We're big believers in staking with cages because we find it's a permanent solution to staking and we don't have problems as the season progresses with the staking method not supporting the vine." -- John Valentino

- Use custom steel wire cages (welded or purchased online) combined with lodgepole stakes pounded into the ground.
- Standard store-bought tomato cages are inadequate for large varieties.
- Stake within 3 weeks of planting.

#### Sucker Pruning

> "You want to remove some of the suckers because we want a lot of energy to go to the tomatoes... The sucker is between the leaves and the main branch." -- John Valentino

- At one month, identify 2--3 suckers per plant and remove them.
- Continue removing suckers as plants grow, but do not over-prune.
- "Very minor pruning because we still need a lot of vegetative growth through photosynthesis."
- In extreme heat, leave extra foliage to shade the fruit.

#### Thinning for Size

- To grow the biggest possible tomatoes, thin fruit to only about a third, keeping only the healthiest tomatoes on the outside of the plant where they get sun.
- Remove smaller tomatoes and leave the largest.

#### Blossom End Rot

> "There's only one thing that causes blossom end rot and that's a shortage of calcium -- but not always caused by not enough calcium in the soil. It's more like the plant's inability to uptake it and that could be caused by a lot of different things including environmental factors -- too much heat, too much water, not enough water." -- John Valentino

- Whopper variety appears more susceptible.
- Often resolves on its own as environmental conditions stabilize.

#### Watering Protocol (Oscar's Method)

| Stage | Frequency | Method |
|---|---|---|
| At planting | Thorough initial watering | Two 2-gallon emitters for 20 minutes |
| Growing season | Every other day | Drip irrigation, 30 minutes per session |
| Extreme heat (100+ degrees F) | Every day | Same drip setup, ensure good drainage |
| Near ripening | Reduce water | Concentrates sugars for sweeter fruit |

#### Other Warm-Season Crops

Oscar's garden also produces: corn, berries, grapes, watermelon, cantaloupes, and peppers -- all benefiting from the same soil-health approach.

## Citrus Growing

Citrus is a staple of the Zone 9 edible landscape. John Valentino treats citrus as both functional (fruit production) and ornamental (screening, fragrance, structure).

### Recommended Citrus Varieties

| Variety | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Navel Orange | Standard orange | Reliable producer; beautiful color change to watch daily |
| Blood Orange | Specialty orange | "Not more pernickety than a regular old navel orange"; prize for baking (blood orange tart) |
| Cara Cara Orange | Pink-fleshed orange | Nice pink flesh; semi-dwarf available |
| Satsuma Mandarin | Mandarin / tangerine | Easy to peel, generally seedless; John's preferred type |
| Clementine | Mandarin | Another dwarf citrus option |
| Golden Nugget | Mandarin | Compact variety |
| Pixie Mandarin | Mandarin | Good for uniform hedgerow planting |
| Bear's Lime | Lime | Stays small; great for cocktails and cooking |
| Limequat | Lime hybrid | Perfect poolside plant for fresh drinks |
| Meyer Lemon | Lemon | Popular but can struggle; watch for chlorosis |
| Kumquat | Citrus relative | Eat fresh (about 10 at a time), or make marmalade |
| Buddha's Hand | Specialty citrus | Unusual ornamental and culinary citrus |

### Citrus Growing Tips

- **Sizes:** Available in full-size, semi-dwarf, and dwarf. Semi-dwarf and dwarf varieties work well in raised planters and containers.
- **Containers:** "Citrus do great in pots and they'll stay in a pot for a long time."
- **Uses in landscape:** Screening shrubs, espalier on fences, patio trees, background hedges.
- **Frost protection philosophy:** Focus on soil and plant health rather than building structures. In Fresno, citrus would need historically low temperatures (below 20 degrees F) to be killed.

> "For citrus I like to do not much. We've encouraged them during the year to be as healthy as possible. I'm not a fan of covering them in any way... what you're protecting is the crop not the tree." -- John Valentino

> "I love having a citrus tree close to the pool... because when I can pick a fresh lime or limequat and put it in my vodka tonic. Wow." -- Eddie the Lazy Landscaper

- **Planting timing:** Do not plant citrus in the middle of winter, even in mild areas. They are sensitive right after planting, and a frost could impact them negatively.
- **Sucker removal on fruit trees:** Go around looking for suckers at the bottom of the trunk. Cut them so all energy goes up to the branches. Also remove dead branches and anything not growing productively.
- **Mandarin quality test:** "I define a good mandarin orange as one that's easy to peel and no seeds."

### Blood Oranges

> "Blood oranges are like growing oranges. They're not more pernickety than a regular old navel orange." -- John Valentino

Sherry, a homeowner featured in the series, won an award at Byerly Gardens for her blood orange tart recipe using three blood oranges and one and a half lemons with a graham cracker crust and brown sugar meringue top.

## Herbs

> "You should never buy another herb from a grocery store. And the reason is simple. Once you've tasted some from your home garden, you'll never go back." -- John Valentino

### Five Tips for Growing Herbs (John Valentino)

1. **Start with healthy soil.** The same soil-health principles apply. Use earthworm castings, quality compost, or concentrated soil amendments. In containers, start with good potting soil (e.g., Black Gold) and add beneficial microbiology.

2. **Prune for yield and flavor.** Cut back once a year to encourage new growth -- it is the new growth that is most flavorful. Prune when done blooming. For woody herbs like rosemary, prune out dead wood freely.

3. **Harvest at first bloom for peak flavor.** "You'll notice that their fragrance and their flavor maximizes around the first bloom. That's the case with rosemary and with oregano."

4. **Water carefully.** Water as little as possible while keeping plants healthy. Many herbs (oregano, rosemary) are Mediterranean plants that are very water-efficient and can get by on once-a-week watering in the ground. In containers during hot summers, daily watering may be necessary. Avoid saturated roots.

5. **Containers vs. ground -- mostly interchangeable.** Exceptions: grow aggressive spreaders like mint in containers. In cold zones, containers let you move herbs to warm microclimates in winter.

### Specific Herbs

| Herb | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Cilantro** | Plant from seed; germinates well in warm weather (80 degrees F) as long as seeds stay moist. Grows in zones 8--11. Bolts in heat. Repels aphids and whitefly; attracts pollinators and beneficials. Essential for guacamole and salsa. |
| **Oregano** | Multiple varieties available. Flavor peaks at first bloom. Dry it by hanging bundles for two weeks, then strip into a colander -- rub leaves and flowers through. Store in jars; use within a year for best flavor. John's grandfather taught him this method. |
| **Parsley** | Enhances cauliflower and other winter vegetables. Listed among recommended herb-garden plants. |
| **Dill** | Pairs especially well with roasted cauliflower. Cool-season herb. |
| **Rosemary** | Gets woody over time; prune out dead wood. Very water-efficient (Mediterranean type). Can be used as ground cover under citrus. "Little Ragu" cultivar of bay tree serves similar screening function. |
| **Basil** | Warm-season herb; listed among recommended container herbs. |
| **Mint** | Aggressive grower -- best kept in containers or bordered areas. |

### Bonus: Drying Oregano (John Valentino's Family Method)

> "My grandfather, John Valentino, taught me this method of drying oregano that makes oregano something that you'll almost want to put on every dish." -- John Valentino

1. Harvest just as blooming begins (peak flavor).
2. Bundle and hang to dry for about two weeks. Do not over-dry or it loses color and turns brown.
3. Strip dried leaves and flowers into a colander.
4. Rub through the colander to remove stems.
5. Store in glass jars. Use within one year for best aroma and flavor.

## Soil Preparation for Edibles

### The Core Philosophy

> "Fertilizer is for plants. It's not for soil. For soil, we need products that encourage life. The soil can be improved dramatically with products that increase complex life in the soil -- beneficial bacteria, fungi, protozoa, good nematodes." -- John Valentino

### For In-Ground Vegetable Gardens

**Pre-planting protocol (winter crops):**
1. After removing spent summer crops, sprinkle Maximize (functions like high-quality compost / earthworm castings) over bare ground.
2. Allow a couple of light rains or water in lightly.
3. At planting time, mix Blend into the backfill so it goes right up to the roots.
4. After plants begin to root, spray Penetrate Liquid Biotiller over the area a few times.

> "We sprinkled Maximize all over, which really functions like a high-quality compost... And then we had a couple of light rains and we raked that in just lightly. As we got ready to plant, we used Blend. And so the Blend gets mixed in right with the backfill and that goes right up to the roots of these plants." -- John Valentino

### For Raised Beds and Containers

- **Potting soil base:** Use quality potting soil (e.g., Black Gold) or make your own mix.
- **Homemade potting soil recipe formula:** One part Optimize, two parts Nourish Biosol, three parts Maximize (the "1-2-3 recipe").
- **Enrich with:** Blend, Penetrate Liquid Biotiller, earthworm castings.
- **Key insight:** "In raised planters and pots you'll never have to change your soil again if you annually treat it with Blend and Penetrate Liquid Biotiller."
- **Important:** "Raised beds or pots -- you need to apply more amendments / fertilizers than you would in the ground. The water leeches through faster and leeches the soil faster."
- **For containers, double the application rate** when using Blend.

### Blend Application Rates

| Situation | Blend Amount |
|---|---|
| 1-gallon container | 1--2 cups |
| 5-gallon container | About 3 cups |
| 15-gallon container | About 5 cups |
| Small plants and starters | 1 cup |
| Small trees and shrubs | 1.5 cups |
| Large trees and shrubs | 3 cups |
| Tomato plants (heavy feeders) | 2 cups in backfill |
| Broadcast over area | 6 lb bag treats about 350 sq ft |

> "Don't worry, you don't need to be precise. You can't burn it and you can't over-apply." -- John Valentino

---

## Fertilization Schedule for Heavy Feeders

Tomatoes and other vegetables are heavy feeders. Here is the protocol used in the "World's Biggest Tomato" series:

### At Planting (One-Time Heavy Application)

1. **Blend** -- 2 cups mixed directly into the backfill surrounding the root ball. Contains mycorrhizae that need to touch roots to colonize.
2. **Nourish Biosol** -- 1 cup sprinkled over the top and lightly incorporated. Provides slow-release nutrients, minerals, and enzymes. Breaks down slowly, nourishing over a long period.

> "We found that tomatoes are very heavy feeders. We found better performance of the tomatoes by using a larger amount... I just do it at the beginning and I think it works great especially if you use enough to start with." -- John Valentino

### Ongoing Maintenance

- **Penetrate Liquid Biotiller** -- once a week, applied to the root zone (about 1 gallon per application). Can also be sprayed on leaves once they are established (avoid spraying very tiny leaves as it can desiccate them).
- This weekly application serves as both a soil improver and subtle fertilizer containing beneficial minerals, kelp, and liquid humic acid.

### General Vegetable Crops (3--4 Month Crops)

> "I usually do just one application for vegetable crops that only last three or four months. On fruit trees and crops that stay in the ground, maybe like certain berry crops, then you would apply more than once -- apply in the spring and then again about mid to late summer." -- John Valentino

### Recommended Schedule Summary

| Timing | Product | Application |
|---|---|---|
| At planting | Blend | 1--2 cups per plant (in backfill) |
| At planting | Nourish Biosol | 1 cup per plant (top-dressed) |
| Weekly | Penetrate Liquid Biotiller | ~1 gallon per plant in root zone |
| Spring (annual) | Blend | Broadcast application |
| Fall (annual) | Blend | Second annual application |
| Fruit trees: spring + mid-summer | Blend | Two applications per year |

> "Blend is 100% organic, safe for people and pets." -- John Valentino

## Planting Calendar by Zone

### Zone 9 (Fresno, CA and Similar Climates)

| Crop | Planting Window | Expected Harvest |
|---|---|---|
| Onions | Late October -- November | Several months later (spring) |
| Cilantro | October -- November (from seed) | Ongoing until heat causes bolting |
| Broccoli (Marathon, Artwork) | October -- November | Mid-to-late December onward |
| Cauliflower (Snowball) | October -- November | December -- February |
| Radishes | November | 30 days after planting (early December) |
| Romaine Lettuce | Fall (target 45--75 degree F temps) | ~60 days |
| Broccoli Rabe | Fall | Before warm weather triggers bolting |
| Detroit Dark Beets | Fall -- Winter | Winter |
| Kale, Spinach, Celery, Carrots | Fall -- Winter | Throughout winter |
| Tomatoes | March 15 -- April 15 (latest: early May) | Summer through fall |
| Herbs (cilantro) | Fall (zones 8--11) | Ongoing |
| Herbs (basil, warm-season) | Spring | Summer |
| Citrus (plant new trees) | Spring (avoid mid-winter planting) | Varies by variety |

### Other Zones (General Guidelines)

| Zone Range | Cool-Season Crops | Warm-Season Crops |
|---|---|---|
| Zones 2--6 | Plant in late summer for fall harvest | Standard spring planting after last frost |
| Zones 7--8 | Fall planting possible; check local frost dates | Similar to Zone 9 but slightly later |
| Zone 9 | Fall/winter planting (Oct--Nov) | Mid-March through April |
| Zones 10--11 | Nearly year-round; watch for excessive heat | Early spring; shade cloth may be needed in summer |

> "Target your planting dates to recognize that optimal growing temperatures -- 45 to 75 degrees [for romaine lettuce]." -- John Valentino

## Germination Tips

> "Germination is usually -- well it can be related to soil -- but it's usually related to how you keep the seeds moist." -- John Valentino

### The #1 Issue: Moisture, Not Soil

When a homeowner (Sherry) was having trouble germinating vegetables in her raised beds, John's diagnosis was direct:

> "Germination is usually -- well it can be related to soil -- but it's usually related to how you keep the seeds moist." -- John Valentino

### Keys to Successful Germination

1. **Moisture is paramount.** Keep seeds consistently moist, not soaked. "The formula for fast germination: warmth and moisture. If you have warmth from the sun and then you can keep that seed moist, it's going to spring up really, really quickly."

2. **Warmth helps.** Water during the day when temperatures are rising, not overnight. "We don't water in the middle of the night or early in the morning. We wait till the sun comes up and as soon as it starts getting warm, we start watering."

3. **Frequency over volume.** "We don't want a lot of water. We just want frequent water right on the surface to keep that seed moist."

4. **Expect germination in 7 to 21 days** for most crops.

5. **Top-dress mulch after seeding** (a thin layer, about 1/8 inch) conserves moisture and creates a little warmth. Use fine wood-based compost.

6. **Apply soil amendments on top of seeds**, not underneath. "You put that seed on, then you put on the Blend or the Optimize... If you're going to use a top dressing, you put the top dress on and then you spray that Penetrate Liquid Biotiller right over."

### Special Case: Cilantro from Seed

> "This weather today, a high of 80 degrees, perfect to germinate cilantro as long as you keep the seeds moist." -- John Valentino

### Special Case: Big Zach Tomatoes from Seed

When John could not find Big Zach tomato starts at nurseries, he grew them from seed. They were planted as tiny seedlings (about an inch tall) in mid-May and grew vigorously, reaching blooming stage by mid-summer despite the late start.

## Raised Beds vs. In-Ground

### Raised Beds / Planters

**Advantages:**
- Better soil quality control -- you fill them with the ideal mix
- Ergonomic -- "nice to garden in because of the quality of the soil and proximity to your height, so you don't have to bend down a lot"
- Can use corrugated steel, wood, or containers
- Good for small spaces and urban gardens
- Can grow tomatoes in containers as small as 15 gallons

**Considerations:**
- More expensive to set up
- Soil leeches faster -- requires more frequent amendment applications (double the application rate for Blend)
- Can be visually unattractive between crops; consider screening with shrubs
- Need their own irrigation valve/station, separate from landscape plants

> "For vegetable gardening you've got a few decisions to make. Exposure first of all -- mostly full sun or a lot of sun, that's what most vegetables need. And then you want to decide if you want to grow in a raised planter, which are more expensive but are really nice to garden in." -- John Valentino

**Raised bed soil strategy:**
- Use quality potting soil (Black Gold) or make your own (1-2-3 recipe: 1 part Optimize, 2 parts Nourish Biosol, 3 parts Maximize).
- Add earthworm castings as both amendment and mulch.
- Treat annually with Blend and Penetrate Liquid Biotiller -- "you'll never have to change your soil again."

### In-Ground

**Advantages:**
- Much more cost-effective for large gardens
- Natural soil ecosystem can be built over time
- Less frequent amendment needed
- Better moisture retention

**Considerations:**
- May need significant soil improvement initially
- More weed pressure (more water coverage = more weeds)
- Need to address drainage, especially in heavy soil
- Can water individual plants rather than whole beds (reducing weed pressure)

> "If you want to do a large garden it's much more cost effective to do it in the ground. And maybe you already have great soil and so in the ground isn't going to be a problem." -- John Valentino

### Irrigation Best Practice (Both Methods)

> "Try to set up your irrigation system where you separate the vegetable garden from anything else. More water, more weeds." -- John Valentino

- Vegetables need different watering schedules than ornamental landscape plants.
- Put vegetable beds on their own valve/station on the irrigation controller.
- Raised beds with lighter soil will need different watering times/days than in-ground plantings.

### Mulching in the Vegetable Garden

- Use a 2-inch layer of mulch (earthworm castings work well as mulch with dual benefit).
- Combine mulching with hand-pulling weeds for long-term organic weed control.
- "Mulch and pulling weeds combination over time is tremendously effective at weed control."
