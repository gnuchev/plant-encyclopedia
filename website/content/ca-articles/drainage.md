# Drainage Solutions Guide

**Extracted from YouTube transcripts by John Valentino / John and Bob's (Fresno, CA -- Zone 9)**

Drainage is one of the most consequential -- and most overlooked -- aspects of residential landscaping. John Valentino returns to this subject across dozens of videos, drawing on lessons from 45+ years of landscape contracting in California's Central Valley. This guide consolidates his core drainage advice using direct quotes from the transcripts.

## Why Drainage Matters

John considers drainage one of the single most important concerns in any landscape, right from the design phase:

> "Drainage, in my opinion, is right up there. One of the most important things. We don't want water sitting up near the house."

The consequences of poor drainage are both horticultural and structural:

> "Poor drainage makes plants fail. Your trees aren't going to grow if they're constantly have saturated roots. And probably even more expensive from a standpoint of losing thousands of dollars is the effect on your house where you get mold issues and you get degradation issues where things start to rot."

> "So, what we're trying to do is keep that house dry all the way around. That's how you can save thousands of dollars in maintenance down the road."

Standing water in hot climates is especially dangerous:

> "When the soil becomes saturated, it's like an anaerobic condition and essentially it can't breathe. There's no exchange of air and water. It's just stagnant."

> "If you have standing water or just saturated areas of the soil and this oppressive heat, that's really what breeds disease."

## Downspout Management

Roof runoff is one of the largest single sources of problem water. John's first priority is always capturing and redirecting it:

> "A lot of the water comes off your roof. Some people have gutters. Then you focus on where those downspouts are and you capture that water and deliver it to a logical place."

> "The logical place is at the gutter or you can dump it out close to the street, but you want to get it away from your house."

In one project on sandy soil, John used a simple dry-well approach for a downspout:

> "We have a drain for the downspout that drains the roof. Really sandy soil here so we dug a big hole filled it with gravel. The combination of the gravel and the sand will drain very well. If we were in heavy soil we would have put a pipe on it and took it to the street."

This illustrates a key principle: the right downspout solution depends on your soil type. Sandy soil can absorb redirected water locally; heavy clay soil requires piping it away entirely.

### Connecting Downspouts to a Drainage System

On one return visit to a project installed seven years earlier, John connected a gutter downspout chain into his existing underground drainage network:

> "The water would come down, this would fill up and then it would just drain out. What we did now is we connected our system. We put in a drain... and we connected that drain to the existing 3-inch drainage line, solid drainage line that we had put in 7 years earlier."

> "It's a gravity flow and it goes down until it empties out into the street."

## Solid Pipe vs. Perforated Pipe

This is one of John's most emphatic and frequently repeated recommendations. He consistently warns against perforated drainage pipe (pipe with holes) and advocates for solid pipe.

### The Problem with Perforated Pipe

> "If you're trying to get water away either through downspouts or just by drain inlets, you want to use solid pipe. Some people use pipe with holes in it with the idea that the water will seep into the soil as it goes. The problem with that is if you have plants nearby, the roots go into those holes and end up plugging up the drainage pipes."

In one dramatic case study, John showed the aftermath of perforated pipe after 35 years:

> "A common occurrence is to have a low spot in your yard and no good way to get water out of... about 35 years ago when the house was built they decided to get that standing water out by putting in a drain line that starts right here and it goes about 225 feet to the street. Over time the system became less effective."

When they dug it up, the root intrusion was catastrophic:

> "You can see what we ended up with here is roots inside the pipe... the root went inside it, it makes it so the pipe isn't even round anymore... this is just a complete clog. No way to clean this or use a roto-router or anything."

> "A type of pipe was used that has holes in it on purpose... the thinking is as it goes on its way out to the street and the gutter the water can go back down into the soil and you don't dump it all out into the gutter. The problem with that is those holes are prime spots for trees or large shrubs or aggressive ground cover to grow into those with the roots and then the roots can plug them up."

### Why Solid Pipe Is Better

John's standard specification is solid PVC drainage pipe:

> "What we're going to use instead is this PVC drainage pipe. This is 3-inch, comes in 10-foot lengths. It has a coupling at each end and very easy to install."

> "With solid pipe like this you can prevent the entrance of roots."

> "The other nice thing about this is it's smooth on the inside and it's continuous and so plumbing equipment can easily go in there and clean these out. The ones that are corrugated, the equipment sometimes gets caught and puts holes in it and it's a problem."

Even solid pipe needs vigilance at the inlet points:

> "The only problem we've had when we've used this is if we put a lot of inlets. So an inlet is the place the water goes in. Sometimes the root will go in the inlet and so you have to watch out for that."

### Seven-Year Checkup: Solid Pipe Holds Up

On revisiting a project after seven years:

> "All of our pipes that we installed 7 years ago appear to be in really good shape. No damage, no breaking of pipes, no roots damaging it because it's solid white drainage pipe."

> "We've talked before about some drainage line that has holes in it. Problem with those holes is roots go in there and fill it up and plug it. There's no holes in this. We just take that water where we want to take it."

## Gravity Drainage Systems

John's preferred drainage hierarchy starts with the simplest approach -- gravity -- and escalates only as needed:

> "The most common way to drain is with gravity. You grade your soil properly just to have it drain. But then when that presents problems, then you can resort to French drains, dry wells, drains that have inlets."

> "So if you look around your house, we want to try to figure out where most of the water is collecting and then we want to figure out how it can just with gravity flow out to where you want it to flow to."

### Using the Driveway Slope

When installing a replacement drainage line, John took advantage of existing grade:

> "This drainage pipe was installed right along the edge of the driveway and since the driveway slopes down it's really a fairly simple installation. You just keep it at the same distance below the driveway and it flows all the way to the street."

### French Drains and Other Escalations

When gravity grading alone is not sufficient -- for example, in areas with compacted clay or hard pan -- John moves to engineered solutions:

> "Being in that part of town in the northwest, we did have some compacted clay and even some hard pan in certain areas. So what we did is we had a drainage system put in with some French drains with pipes leading out to the gutter and that helped."

> "Those solutions are easier to accomplish if you plan them out before you put in your landscape."

## Preventing Water Collection Near Foundations

John views foundation drainage as a first-order design concern, not an afterthought:

> "You figure out what's the best way to drain this landscape away from the house."

> "We don't want water sitting up near the house. I've seen lots of problems created by creative landscape designs a lot of times with mounding or other changes in grade that doesn't adequately address how the site drains."

### The Mounding Trap

Decorative mounds and topography features can inadvertently dam water against the house:

> "Folks want to have topography. They want to have mounds, but if they're not placed in the correct way, they can cause some drainage problems on their own. Man-made drainage problems."

> "Between the mound and the house you trap water. So these are areas that really need to be addressed right from the start. We want to grade this in a way that all the water runs off properly."

### Foundation Planting Compounds the Problem

Oversized shrubs pressed against the house make drainage worse and maintenance harder:

> "Many, many landscapes that you see have plants that are usually too big for their spot right up next to the house, and that is called foundation planting."

> "We don't need to plant plants too close to the house that then invade on the windows, on the roof, make it hard to do common maintenance."

> "Let's do away with foundation planting. Let's focus on creative spaces in our garden and plants farther out away from our house."

### The House Must Stay Dry

The financial stakes are clear:

> "The effect on your house where you get mold issues and you get degradation issues where things start to rot."

> "Your basement floods next week and you didn't [subscribe], it's on you."

## Drain Inlets and Gutter Systems

Drain inlets are the surface collection points that feed underground pipe systems. John uses them in combination with gravity piping:

> "We put in a drainage system here... which has a drain inlet there and a drain inlet there. We put this in when we installed the yard. So it's a gravity flow and it goes down until it empties out into the street."

### Testing Your System

John recommends periodic testing -- at least annually:

> "One good way to check it is when it's warm you put a hose on one inlet and make sure that water goes where it's supposed to and if it starts backing up then you know you've got a problem."

> "We wanted to make sure this was working right so we put a hose in it and we filled it with water and it for a few minutes it was fine until the pipe filled up and then it would start overflowing which allowed us to figure out aha it's not draining."

In that case, the outlet was blocked by roots from an adjacent plant:

> "A Little John bottlebrush right at the street had put roots and gone into the place where the water comes out to drain to the street. It had come from the top, not from the soil. It was seeking water."

> "When we took all the roots out it's working great now. Probably once a year you need to make sure that Little John bush isn't putting roots into my outlet for the drainage system."

### Pervious Paving as a Drainage Tool

John also advocates pervious paving materials to reduce the volume of runoff that needs to be managed:

> "The reason they want pervious paving is that it minimizes the need for big drainage basins and swales and concrete curbs."

> "Pervious means that it'll filter right through the paving. As it's going through the paving, it mixes with microbes and these products that are pervious actually filter the water and as it gets into the groundwater, it's clean water."

## Grading and Slope Considerations

Proper grading is the foundation of all drainage. John learned this the hard way on his very first job in 1979:

> "When we first went into business in 1979, one of the first jobs we did, the builder builds the house and we work out a beautiful plan and then we're provided the landscape and we go at it. And we relied on the general contractor to grade it properly. That winter it rained like crazy and they had all kinds of problems with water intrusion into their house. Then they go to their attorney and they sue their builder and they sue the landscape contractor. They sue everybody."

> "That is a big lesson that I learned in that very first job is to pay a lot of attention to how your yard drains and try to get that water out."

### Include a Drainage Plan in Your Landscape Plan

> "It would be nice as part of our landscape plan to come up with a drainage plan that addresses that right from the start. From there, we can be very creative with a landscape that we know drains effectively."

### Planting Above Grade

For trees and shrubs, John consistently recommends planting slightly high rather than low:

> "One of the most important things on plants and trees is not to allow them to settle below grade where water can collect around the base of the tree. So we want to plant them a little bit high."

> "This root ball can be well a half an inch to an inch high above grade."

> "We generally plant fruit trees like this slightly high and then we would build a basin right when we plant it but then we would do away with the basin so that the water always drains off and drains away."

## Common Drainage Mistakes

### 1. Using Perforated Pipe Near Plants

This is John's most repeated warning. Roots inevitably find the holes and destroy the system:

> "Roots go into those holes and end up plugging up the drainage pipes."

> "Those holes are prime spots for trees or large shrubs or aggressive ground cover to grow into."

### 2. Ignoring Drainage in the Design Phase

> "A good landscape design will help you avoid overplanting... I've seen lots of problems created by creative landscape designs a lot of times with mounding or other changes in grade that doesn't adequately address how the site drains."

> "Drainage is part of a bigger problem that usually starts before a plant is even in the ground."

### 3. Relying on Someone Else to Grade Properly

> "We relied on the general contractor to grade it properly. That winter it rained like crazy and they had all kinds of problems with water intrusion into their house."

Builders often skip proper soil and grading work:

> "Builders and developers hire landscape contractors to landscape yards and they get bids. So they're usually interested in hiring the least expensive bid... you see many many landscapes where they just drive a tractor and level everything, put sod right on top and put mulch right on top, but no consideration at all is given to soil preparation."

> "Lack of consideration for soil health affects all kinds of things including poor drainage and disease."

### 4. Never Testing the Drainage System

> "Probably once a year you need to make sure that Little John bush isn't putting roots into my outlet for the drainage system."

> "You really should check it more than every seven years. You should probably check it about once a year or once every other year."

### 5. Putting Gravel in the Bottom of Planting Holes / Pots

John debunks this popular practice on drainage grounds:

> "If we put a bunch of gravel in the bottom of the pot and then we fill the rest up with a really good quality potting soil, that potting soil will not drain into and through the gravel until the top layer, which is a completely different texture, becomes saturated."

> "We don't want saturation. We want drainage. So, you are impeding drainage when you put a layer of gravel."

### 6. Backfilling Tree Holes with Amended Soil

Using soil that is dramatically different from the native creates a drainage barrier:

> "Some are tempted to dig this hole and then put brand new beautiful soil in there that's completely different than the native soil. I don't recommend that. What that does is create what some people call like the bathtub effect where that just sits there and roots won't go into it, water won't go out of it."

### 7. Creating Mounds That Trap Water Against the House

> "If they're not placed in the correct way, they can cause some drainage problems on their own. Man-made drainage problems."

> "Between the mound and the house you trap water."

### 8. Overwatering in Heavy Clay Soil

Clay soil is not inherently bad, but it demands careful water management:

> "Clay soil tends to usually be full of minerals and it retains nutrients very well and it's actually a good growing medium if you can master the poor drainage part where you don't overwater it."

> "You'd like for it never to dry out completely but never to be saturated either."

## DIY Drainage Replacement: Step-by-Step Summary

From John's detailed video on replacing a failed 225-foot drainage line, here is the process:

1. **Remove the old pipe and dig the trench.** Expect to encounter roots. Use a sharpshooter shovel to cut through them cleanly.

2. **Install new solid PVC pipe.** 3-inch PVC in 10-foot lengths with couplings. Maintain consistent depth below the driveway or grade line to ensure gravity flow.

3. **Test the sprinklers.** Digging may have damaged irrigation lines running nearby.

4. **Test the drain line.** Start at the inlet with a hose, fill the system with water, and confirm it flows freely to the outlet at the street.

5. **Backfill and clean up.**

> "This is a subject that comes up all the time so I hope it's helpful and I think it serves to educate on a topic that is just taken for granted but is frequently a big problem. When your drainage system stops working you have flooding and that's bad."

## Quick Reference: Drainage Hierarchy

| Priority | Method | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Gravity grading** | Always -- the first line of defense |
| 2 | **Downspout capture + solid pipe to street** | When roof runoff is a problem |
| 3 | **Drain inlets + solid pipe** | Low spots that collect water |
| 4 | **French drains** | Compacted clay / hard pan areas |
| 5 | **Dry wells** | Sandy soil, localized collection |
| 6 | **Pervious paving** | Reduce overall runoff volume |

> "The most common way to drain is with gravity. You grade your soil properly just to have it drain. But then when that presents problems, then you can resort to French drains, dry wells, drains that have inlets."
