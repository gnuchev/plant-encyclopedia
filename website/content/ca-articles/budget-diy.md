## The Core Philosophy

> "If you'd like your garden to look like this, but your budget looks like this, then keep watching. You don't need a full expensive garden makeover to make your outdoor spaces look amazing. You just need to know what's important to focus on."

> "Landscapes should add value and not drain your wallet. So, if you're fired up to improve your landscape and garden, but your budget is tight, don't worry."

## 1. Salvaged Materials -- Steve's Garden Tour

John introduces his friend Steve, who transformed an entire front yard on almost no money:

> "Let me introduce you to Steve. He transformed his space using repurposed finds and creativity, spending little to no money."

### Fire Brick Walkways

Steve rescued fire bricks destined for the dump and laid them into a walkway over decomposed granite:

> "What these are considered is fire bricks. And fire bricks are using, for instance, like kilns and that. And these bricks were going out to the dump and there was a big pile of them. And I was asked, would you be able to repurpose these into something of value? And I said, 'Yeah, I could probably put this in my front yard and make the yellow brick road.'"

> "I started at that end by the driveway and I worked this way. It took me 6 months to do this whole project... I did it all myself. I didn't have any help. And I used whatever pieces that I was able to salvage to put it together."

He laid the bricks on salvaged decomposed granite:

> "And what did you lay it on top of?" / "I used decomposed granite." / "Was the decomposed granite salvaged?" / "Yes."

### Salvaged Decorative Metalwork

Steve found ornamental metal in a salvage yard and used it as a backdrop for a potted Japanese maple:

> "It is salvage. I did pay very little for it and was something that was actually in a pile of metal that was in a salvage yard. I just used it for decorative purposes."

### Scrap Metal Fence

Steve's fence was built from scrap materials gathered from a metal fabrication shop and welded by a friend:

> "We went to a place that actually fabricate different types of metals and they were throwing this out. It was scrap and just had it framed out and then welded together. A friend of mine does welding."

### Salvaged Banister Fence

> "This particular fence here that actually separates us from the neighbors was salvaged from a neighbor around the corner and he was ready to throw it out because it was a banister for their second story and decided it wasn't safe. So I asked if I could have it and he gave it to me and I installed it and that began the whole process of wanting my fence with circles."

### Salvaged Rock (With a Borrowed Truck)

> "A friend of mine had some -- he was going to do some rock work and he didn't care for it. And so I just simply said, 'Can I have this?' So I brought it home in my neighbor's pickup that I borrowed that I didn't have to pay for."

> "Even the pickup was salvaged."

The rock serves double duty:

> "Not only did I get it salvaged and repurposed, but it keeps the dogs from walking around my lamps, my path lighting all the way through."

### Salvaged Tractor Disc Water Feature / Bird Bath

Steve built a water feature almost entirely from scrap:

> "My wife and I love birds, so we thought the best thing to do was to bring in a water feature. And this water feature is completely free without -- with the exception of the pump that's underneath. And what this is is salvaged tractor disc. And then below that is a stand pipe, irrigation stand pipe. And inside that's a pump. It pumps the water up, drops back down in there."

> "I would suggest people look for scrap to make their bird bath because bird baths are very expensive."

### John's Summary of Steve's Approach

> "As you've seen, Steve did spend a little bit of money here and there over time to get his garden to look like this."

> "How our friend Steve transformed his landscape using nothing but creativity, resourcefulness, hard work, and a lot of salvaged material."

## 2. Free & Low-Cost Plant Sources

### Divisions From Neighbors

> "Many plants for their health need to be divided. And when those divisions occur, you can take plants from neighbors or accept plants from neighbors and use them in your own yard. And that is truly salvaged plants. Here's a list of plants that can be divided. Ask neighbors for cuttings."

### Cuttings and Propagation

> "Many times they have to do some gardening that renders some plants available that they would just throw away otherwise. Even if they're not throwing them away. A lot of times you can take cuttings from plantings that they have. Here's a list of plants that are easy to propagate."

### Garden Club Swaps

> "Also, there's gardening clubs that do swaps where you can easily get plant material or seeds."

### Lawn Plugs From Friends

> "Seeds are very inexpensive and that can be done without a lot of cost. Or you can get cuttings of lawn or plugs of lawn from neighbors and friends that have a lawn and you can get those for free and start that without any cost at all."

### Transplanting What You Already Have

> "Always consider transplanting. So, a lot of the plants might be usable, but they're all jumbled up together in the wrong place. Transplanting them in the fall is good, in the early spring is good, even sometimes in the winter."

> "You can analyze everything in your yard and do divisions, move them around, plant them everywhere you think they might thrive. Sometimes ground cover grows in a way that you can just cut off a piece and restart it."

## 3. Repurposed Containers -- Cracked Pot Repair

Steve's approach to containers is to buy damaged pots at a steep discount, then repair them:

> "I actually purchased that pot and the pot was sitting in the back of a nursery. It had a big crack in it." / "So, I repaired it and brought it home and paid very little for it because it was damaged."

> "I'm starting to notice a theme here." / "Yes, crack pots."

### Nursery Discount Racks

> "You'll look in different areas in a nursery and they have certain areas where they have plants that look like they're ready to die. And so they just put them in a discount place and you can get them for a fraction of the cost -- or annuals they're ready to throw away."

---

## 4. Home Depot Scrap Lumber & Curbside Finds

> "Even Home Depot has lumber scraps they will put in a pile. If you get there early in the morning at 6, you can get that for almost free."

John also encourages a wider scavenging mindset:

> "There are ways to salvage rocks, bricks, stones, pavers... Some people salvage rocks from the side of the road or go to areas that are doing cleanup and just have piles of random rocks. Don't overlook curb finds, dumpsters. Goodwill has giveaways sometimes. Sometimes local businesses like fencing companies put out material that they dig up."

---

## 5. DIY Composting -- Steve's Table-Scraps Method

Steve composts with a simple three-ingredient recipe:

> "Actually, I use table scraps. What I do is I throw my little bucket that I have in the house of all my table scraps. I bring it out here. I throw it in there. Then I turn it 50 times, 50 revolutions. The idea is to always make sure there's air going into it. And that keeps it -- it speeds up the process of decomposition."

> "At first, it took me a long time to figure out how much grass clippings, leaves, and then table scraps. That's basically my recipe."

Turnaround time is roughly six months:

> "And how long does it take you to make finished compost?" / "I'd say at least 6 months."

## 6. Where to Splurge vs. Where to Save

### SAVE: Plant Small Sizes

> "Here's where most people waste a lot of money without knowing it. Most people want it to look full-grown and mature right from the start, but that is very expensive, and that also isn't in the best interest of the plants. The plants do best when you start them out in small sizes. This is really a big area of savings is the size of the plants."

Specific example -- boxwood hedges:

> "A 5-gallon boxwood is probably going to cost you $30. And a one-gallon plant is going to cost you $10 or $12. So if you have 50 of them, you know, that's a $1,000 difference."

> "The least expensive tree if you can find it in a small size makes a lot of sense. Usually you can get to the next size in about one year in the ground."

### SAVE: Seed Your Lawn Instead of Sod

> "Another way to save money with your lawn is to seed the lawn rather than sod the lawn. Most people want to sod the lawn because it gives them this instant effect. But if you pick the right time, you can recreate that look or catch up to that look in just 4 weeks if you do everything right."

The numbers are dramatic:

> "If we were to do 1,000 square feet of sod... you've got about $800 of cost. If you use seed, you've only got about $100 of cost because you're doing all the labor yourself."

### SAVE: Use Mulch Thinner

> "It's amazing how much this can save you. Over 1,000 square ft, if you were to put 2 inches thick of mulch, you would have to use about six cubic yards... it's going to cost you about $600. If you take it down to one inch, I'm just going to make sure to replenish it once a year, you're down to $300 for half the amount of mulch."

### SAVE: Skip Landscape Fabric

> "I don't really like landscape fabric around plants. I'd like you to consider using mulch instead of landscape fabric. If you continue to remulch, you will go a long ways toward producing really active, microbiologically healthy soil."

### SAVE: Repair Your Fence Instead of Replacing It

> "Many people spend thousands of dollars on replacing, but you often don't need to. With a simple mindset shift, you can repurpose what you already have and save a ton of money."

> "If we just reinforce each 4x4 post with a new 4x4 pressure-treated that comes up and finishes a little bit above grade, it's amazing how with very little money, we can completely renovate an existing fence."

The math:

> "If you have 100 ft at $30 a linear foot, you're spending $3,000 to put in a new fence and take out the old one. If you just buy new posts, pressure-treated posts, and use this method that we're showing you here, you can do it for $500."

### SAVE: Run Lighting Wire Now, Buy Fixtures Later

> "Lighting can be expensive, but the wire of the lighting, which is a direct burial... you can run the wire anytime. We like to run it when we're doing the irrigation. So, you could put in the whole system without the lights for very little money, and then a year or two later, you put in the lights. Or maybe you come back and do one or two lights at a time as you can afford to buy them."

This phased approach showed up on a real job site:

> "The other thing that you'll see throughout the garden that was a cost saving measure is these little loops of wire which is where low voltage LED garden lights are going to be going. So that's a way to save money where they're not going to purchase the lights and install the lights until later, maybe a year or two down the road."

The same phased strategy applied to a fountain:

> "One thing that you see -- a big box in the courtyard is a fountain. They purchased the fountain after because of cost and then we just ran water and power to the area so that's waiting to be installed."

### SAVE: LED Bulbs for Landscape Lighting

> "Another way you're saving money by picking the right kinds of lights is use a light with an LED bulb. They use way less electricity and they make the process of putting in the system so much easier because you usually don't have to do a lot of calculations like we used to have to do 25 years ago. With LED bulbs, you can almost just run one wire."

### SAVE: Gravel Paths (Great DIY Project)

> "Easy to do and not expensive, especially if you use some of these ideas that we use, such as a gravel path with edging that is really good for the do-it-yourselfer. We use a little bit of decomposed granite and then we use some kind of gravel on top and usually a vibratory compactor to press it into that DG."

### SAVE: Curb Appeal for Minimal Cost

> "All of those things are inexpensive because it doesn't take much of either. You can buy a yard of mulch for probably $50 or so and you can buy a ton of 3/8-inch California gold for about the same, maybe a little more, $75. And so you can clean up all the surfaces of your garden."

### SPLURGE: Good Quality Edging (Not Plastic)

> "Plastic edging. At first blush, and on paper, it's great. It's cheap, and it seems to do the job, but it does many things poorly."

> "You add it all up and you've got a cheap material that performs cheaply and not effectively."

> "Don't use cheap plastic edging. It doesn't hold its shape well. Even though it's cheaper, it's not worth it in the long run."

> "You might save money up front, but in the end, you'll need to replace it if you want it to look good and you want it to function properly."

### SPLURGE: Good Tools

> "In all cases, invest in good quality tools and they'll last you a long time and they'll allow you to do a really good job."

### SPLURGE: Trees (They Pay You Back)

> "Mature trees in a well landscaped yard increase home values by 7 to 19% and that's by records of home sales."

> "If you plant the right tree in the right place that screens western and southern sun, they save $6 to $270 per tree in energy bills."

## 7. When to Hire a Pro vs. DIY

### Hire a Pro: Irrigation Systems

> "DIY projects can be a great way to save money until you have to pay two or three times as much to fix what went wrong."

> "One where it really doesn't work, installing your own irrigation system. More and more irrigation systems in order to perform properly are pretty sophisticated installation proposals. And so I frequently discourage people from installing their own irrigation system or for sure discourage them from designing their own irrigation system."

> "If you hire a licensed contractor, it's really going to vary, but probably somewhere in the $2 to $3 a square foot range. So, if you have say 1,500 square feet front yard, you're around $5,000."

### Hire a Pro: Concrete & Masonry Work

> "Another good example is something like concrete work. Stamped concrete, colored concrete, even gray concrete requires a lot of experience to do the proper finish and to have it drained properly and look properly."

> "Making yourself aware of proper construction techniques in terms of footings is important to have a wall that's long-lasting and permanent and doesn't start cracking right after you install it."

### Hire a Pro: Premium Paving

> "This paving material is kind of expensive, probably not a do-it-yourself job although you could do it if you're good at this type of work."

### Hire a Pro: Certain Types of Edging

> "Most likely would want to hire a contractor of some type to install them. So, it's not a do-it-yourself project."

Permalock edging runs about $6 per linear foot installed:

> "Our price for Permalock edging is right up there around $6 a linear foot. It's not inexpensive, but it's a very good product, works very well, and lasts indefinitely."

### DIY-Friendly: Drainage Projects

> "As a do-it-yourself project it's a lot of work but very doable and maybe a project that you get some young hardworking people to help you with and get the right tools and you could do it yourself."

### DIY-Friendly: Trellises and Screens

> "We're here at an interesting little garden where we're going to show you about do-it-yourself trellises for screens and to cover up fences."

### DIY-Friendly: Mulching, Gravel, and Surface Cleanup

> "Even though these materials are readily available and you could do it yourself, you can also hire somebody for very inexpensive amounts to do these kinds of improvements."

### The General Rule

> "If you're apprehensive about a project, it might make a lot of sense to spend the necessary money to get it done properly rather than ending up having to redo it if you're just not properly equipped to do it yourself."

## 8. Budget-Friendly Finishing Touches

John lists quick, inexpensive upgrades that make a garden feel polished:

### Tabletop Fire Features

> "We originally got the idea because we had a candle out here and then we thought, well, a little fire feature would be even a little neater and this is inexpensive. It's like having a miniature fire pit."

### Small Water Features

> "The sound of water in a landscape is amazing. A great addition... there are a lot of neat little water features. And they come in many different shapes and sizes. And the neat thing about them is they look good, but they sound good."

### Vines for Privacy

> "Strategically placed vines are a great addition to the garden, which can add color in the form of bloom, interest in the pattern it makes on a wall, and privacy. The vine can either screen noise or screen views that are undesirable. And in that way, vines can be another part of creating these separate spaces inexpensively."

### Colored Pots

> "Colored pots are another neat idea that we're stealing from Eddie the lazy landscaper. He is lazy, but he can be clever, too. And that addition of colored pots of all different shapes and sizes and colors is a really neat way to add color to your garden."

---

## 9. The Mindset: Think in Spaces, Not Grand Plans

> "A really important way a DIY person can create a low-cost and yet very useful landscape or garden is by keeping in mind the most important part of landscape design. And that is creating spaces."

> "Think about your landscape, your front and your backyards as a series of spaces or segments. These spaces can be very simple and inexpensive. So you don't end up with a real complicated, expensive final product, but you end up with something that you use every day."

> "This idea of creating space is really what landscape architecture and landscape design is all about. And I'd like you to keep that in mind as you plan your garden. And you plan it even in a way where you want to do it as inexpensively as possible."

### Phase Your Budget Over Time

Real project example where budget dictated a phased approach:

> "One of the things here is because of budget a lot of the final parts of the garden aren't completed yet because they're going to be doing them later."
