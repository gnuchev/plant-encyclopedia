## 1. Core Philosophy: Feed the Soil, Not Just the Plant

John Valentino's fertilization philosophy centers on building soil biology rather than force-feeding plants with synthetic nutrients. The entire product line is designed around a single principle:

> "Compost is really fertilizer for soil. And most fertilizers that you buy at garden centers and nurseries are specifically fertilizers for plants that don't benefit the soil."

> "Do I still have to fertilize if I'm using your products? And the answer is no. Our products are a comprehensive approach to feeding your plants and your soil that satisfies the need to do fertilizer in Spring."

The goal over time is soil self-sufficiency:

> "Over time that will lessen because we'll be producing soil that produces its own macronutrients."

> "The more you invest in building it full of life, the less you will need to use inputs like organic fertilizer, any kind of fertilizer, because the soil will be producing its own nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium."

---

## 2. Twice-Yearly Minimum (Spring + Summer)

The baseline recommendation across all products is **two applications per year, spring and fall/summer**:

> "On our label information we say twice a year. So I would do it sometime around the beginning of Spring and then again maybe the beginning of Summer."

> "We recommend two applications in Spring and fall."

> "We encourage people just every 6 months, twice a year. I think that's better from the standpoint of making it easier for gardeners. We're trying to come up with a rate that gives you the most amount of benefit for the least amount of cost."

For established gardens with no problems, even once a year can suffice:

> "Eileen applies our Blend about once a year. And in an established garden that doesn't have any problems, that's plenty. If you have an area where you have some fungal disease or some kind of pests like aphid and whitefly, then I would apply it at least twice a year."

---

## 3. Spring Timing: Temperature Triggers

Spring application timing is driven by **soil temperature and air temperature**, not the calendar date:

> "Spring is definitely the first time to use Nourished Biosol. You wouldn't necessarily want to go just by Spring but a combination of Springtime and relatively warm atmospheric temperatures and relatively warm soil temperatures like **50-55 degrees on the soil, 70 degrees and more as the highs**."

> "Our Nourish Biosol or Value Rich will work as long as the highs are in the 70s. When you get into highs in the 50s or even low 60s and lows in the 30s, then it's less effective."

> "In that temperature fertilizer will release, it will color up the lawn really well."

All products are **activated by water**, not by warmth alone:

> "Unlike traditional chemical fertilizer, dried mycelium you can apply it anytime. It's water that activates it. So at some point you need to water it, but it won't burn your lawn or burn your plants."

## 4. Application Rates by Plant Type

### Lawns: Nourish Biosol

| Scenario | Rate | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Standard lawn feeding | 6-10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft | Twice a year (spring + summer) |
| Heavy / event-prep application | 10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft | One-time boost |
| Deep green maintenance | 6-10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft | Every 6-8 weeks |
| Moderate green maintenance | 6-10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft | Every 8-10 weeks |
| Relaxed maintenance | 6-10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft | Every 12-16 weeks |
| Bermuda aggressive recovery | 12 lbs / 1,000 sq ft | As needed |

> "Nourished Biosol which you would put on at about 6 to 10 lb per thousand square ft and it will address feeding the lawn, feeding the soil."

> "If you want the greenest lawn in your neighborhood you might have to make applications like that every 6 to 8 weeks."

> "If we want to retain this really vibrantly green then maybe we use Nourished Biosol every 8 to 10 weeks. If we're not quite so much of a zealot about a deep green lawn, we can go 12-16 weeks and just have a pleasant green."

> "I'm going to do a heavy application which is about 10 lbs per thousand of Nourished Biosol."

### Lawns: Blend (for sick or problem lawns)

| Scenario | Rate |
|---|---|
| Standard lawn treatment | 8-10 lbs / 1,000 sq ft |
| Heavy treatment / problem lawns | 20 lbs / 1,000 sq ft |
| Fungal disease treatment | 25-30 lbs / 1,000 sq ft |

> "Any time a lawn is sick or underperforming for some reason then I would use Blend because Blend has lots of microbiology in it. If the lawn doesn't particularly have anything wrong with it... then you would use Nourished Biosol because it's Nourished Biosol that has macronutrients in it."

> "That's a very heavy application of Blend, 20 pounds per thousand is pretty heavy. If I know I have fungal problems I'll probably go 25-30 pounds per thousand."

### Roses: Blend + Penetrate Spray

> "A tremendous treatment for roses and we've tried this in different Rose clubs: we've gotten the best results with about **three cups of Blend over the root zone** of the Rose and then spray over that with Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller."

> "I use three cups of Blend on a rose, like right after pruning."

> "You can add to that if you continue to have any kind of pest or disease: you do the Blend and then do about an inch and a half to two inches of earthworm castings over the Blend. That combination feeds the Rose but also does it in a way that limits things like aphid and white fly."

**Timing:** Right after pruning, before spring growth; optionally repeat in fall.

> "Depending on the success of the rose plant and the kinds of problems... at least the one time right after pruning and then I like to spray it with Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller right over the root zone."

### Trees: Blend Over Root Zone

> "My favorite treatment for trees is Blend right over the root zone. So the root zone is all the way out to the edges of the canopy."

> "If everything's going great, just the Blend is a good way to fertilize trees. If you have a tree that tends to get aphid or white fly, use the Blend and then over the Blend as a mulch we use about inch and a half to 2 inches of earthworm castings."

**Blend rates for individual plantings:**

| Plant Size | Blend Amount |
|---|---|
| Small plants & starters | 1 cup |
| Small trees & shrubs | 1.5 cups |
| Large trees & shrubs | 3 cups |
| Containers/planters | Double the above rates |

> "For small plants and starters use one cup. For small trees and shrubs use 1 and 1/2 cups. For large trees and shrubs use three cups."

> "For Planters and containers double the application rate."

### Vegetables: Heavy at Planting or Split Applications

> "You have a choice: you can either do a heavy application right at planting -- I would use Blend and use a good rate of application, so as much as a cup or two say for tomato plants. Usually that will suffice for the entire year."

> "If you wanted to do more, like a half a cup to a cup, you could then do another application in a month and a half or 2 months. But I usually do just one application for vegetable crops that only last three or 4 months."

> "On fruit trees and crops that stay in the ground, maybe like certain berry crops, then you would apply more than once: apply in the spring and then again about mid to late summer."

For tomatoes specifically:

> "We're going to put a cup of Nourished Biosol around each tomato and then he's just lightly incorporating it in the top... since Nourish Biosol is a soil Builder and a fertilizer and has all kinds of nutrients and minerals and enzymes, then it's excellent to use pretty heavily."

> "The formula we're using: the Blend mixed into the backfill, the Nourished Biosol over the top, and then the Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller on a regular basis once a week."

**Oscar's tomato protocol:** Blend in backfill + 1 cup Nourish Biosol on top + weekly Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller spray.

### Annuals & Perennials

> "Use a lot of Blend and Penetrate on it. Get them going real quickly."

> "Use Blend, use Penetrate, and they'll take off and bloom for you for quite a while."

> "All the annuals that bloom in the winter and the early spring and the fall are looking good now... we fed the soil and the poppies right when we planted them with a combination of our Blend which is Optimize, Maximize, Nourish Biosol and Penetrate Liquid Bio Tillers."

**Nourish Biosol individual plant rates:**

| Plant Size | Nourish Biosol Amount |
|---|---|
| Small plants & starters | 1/4 cup |
| Small trees & shrubs | 1/2 cup |
| Large trees & shrubs | 1 cup |

## 5. Monthly Calendar for Zone 9 (Fresno, CA)

| Month | Lawns | Trees & Shrubs | Roses | Vegetables | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **January** | Color fading from fall apps; optional synthetic winterizer if aesthetics matter | No feeding recommended | Pruning month; no feeding yet | Plan spring garden | "In January usually it'll start to look not quite so green." |
| **February** | Apply Nourish Biosol when highs reach 70F+ | Optimize if not done in fall | Apply 3 cups Blend right after pruning + Penetrate spray | Prep beds with Blend | "Soon as we get to February then I'll apply Nourished Biosol again in order to green it up." |
| **March** | Primary spring application: Nourish Biosol 6-10 lbs/1000 sq ft; Blend + Penetrate if lawn has problems | Blend over root zone + Penetrate spray | Penetrate spray follow-up 1-2 weeks after Blend | Plant warm-season crops with Blend in backfill; Nourish Biosol on top | "Spring is definitely the first time to use Nourished Biosol... 50-55 degrees on the soil, 70 degrees and more as the highs." |
| **April** | Continue mowing/watering; reassess color | Monthly Penetrate spray if trees are underperforming | Enjoy first blooms; spray Penetrate monthly | Weekly Penetrate on tomatoes; water properly | "Spring is the best time to start this process of building the soil." |
| **May** | Optional Nourish Biosol if going for deep green (every 6-8 week cycle) | Monitor for pests; treat with Rose & Soil Defender if needed | Monitor for aphid/whitefly; earthworm castings over Blend if pest issues | Heavy feeders (tomatoes) may get supplemental Nourish Biosol | "In terms of an anti-pest regimen, up to 70% of pests start in the soil." |
| **June** | Second application: Nourish Biosol (beginning of summer) | Penetrate spray for heat protection | Continue Penetrate monthly | Continue weekly Penetrate; harvest begins | "I would do it sometime around the beginning of Spring and then again maybe the beginning of Summer." |
| **July** | Optional mid-summer Blend if soil needs it | Blend if needed; "when should I use it? As soon as possible" | Optional second Blend application | Split application crops: second feeding | "Sometimes in July people will ask me when should I use it and the answer is as soon as possible." Be careful with synthetic fertilizer in heat. |
| **August** | Maintain mowing; watch for fungal disease as heat peaks | Continue Penetrate | Minimal intervention; avoid synthetic fertilizer in heat | Late-summer harvest; prepare for fall crops | "You need to be very careful with [synthetics] because they can really burn lawns and plants easily in the summer. Organic products in the summer are fine." |
| **September** | Overseed cool-season grass; apply Blend + Penetrate at seeding | Fall Blend application | Fall pruning if needed; apply Blend after pruning | Plant fall/winter vegetables with Blend + Penetrate | "Fall and spring are the best times to do new planting." |
| **October** | Nourish Biosol fall application; mow overseeded lawns weekly | Blend is good through end of October even in colder climates | One treatment of Blend sufficient for non-heavy feeders | Plant cool-season crops (onions, beets, lettuce, etc.) | "In California... you could apply Blend right through the end of November." |
| **November** | Optional: Nourish Biosol if highs still in 70s; winterizer synthetic for aesthetics only | Optimize application (breaks down slowly through winter) | No feeding | Winter garden establishment | "There's nothing involving health of the soil or the lawn that requires you to fertilize in November. It's purely an aesthetic issue." |
| **December** | Optimize only (slow-release soil conditioner) | Optimize only | No feeding | Maintain winter crops | "November or December... Optimize is a soil conditioner and it breaks down very slowly." In cold climates, apply only Optimize Nov-Dec. |

## 7. Watering After Application

All products are **activated by water** but none will burn if left dry:

> "Blend is activated by water. If you have drip irrigation it'd be nice to apply it when you're still going to have some rain, or you can use your own hose and sprinklers. But you don't need to water it in if you don't want to right away -- it can sit there without burning anything."

> "Nourish Biosol is activated by water. If you have drip irrigation it'd be nice to apply it when you're still going to have some rain."

> "Maximize is activated by water. So if you want it to work, at some point you have to water it. But you don't have to water it right when you put it on."

> "I generally like to put Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller over the top of Blend or Optimize or Nourish Biosol because those need to be watered in anyhow."

**Pro tip -- Penetrate as activator:** Spraying Penetrate over dry products serves double duty: it activates the dry products while simultaneously adding beneficial bacteria and minerals.

> "A helpful tip: apply Blend or any of our dry products and then spray Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller right over the top of them to begin to activate it rather than waiting for rain."

> "You could apply Nourished Biosol and then don't water it for a month -- it won't obviously go to work because water activates it, but it doesn't burn anything."

## 8. Common Fertilization Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Using Only Synthetic Fertilizer

> "Most fertilizers that you buy at garden centers and nurseries are specifically fertilizers for plants that don't benefit the soil."

> "Fertilizer is for plants. It's not for soil. For soil, we need products that encourage life."

> "More chemical fertilizer can make your lawn more susceptible to fungal disease."

### Mistake #2: Overfertilizing with Synthetics (Burning)

> "A lot of home gardeners damage lawn and plants with synthetic fertilizer, which is pretty easy to do when it's hot and impossible to do with any of these products."

> "You need to be very careful with them because they can really burn lawns and plants easily in the summer. Organic products in the summer are fine."

> "If you're overfertilizing, you know, in general, we don't promote using synthetic fertilizers at all, but there might be a time and place for them here and there."

### Mistake #3: Fertilizing in Dormant Season (Wasted Money)

> "I'm not a fan nor do I recommend using fertilizer on plants and trees in the fall and the winter. The exception to that is our Optimize."

> "There are active campaigns from fertilizer companies to get you to fertilize in the fall and even early winter. And in many parts of the country I think that's just a waste of money and not productive because if the soil is dormant and the plants are dormant and you use some kind of fertilizer, when you get moisture it'll break down that fertilizer and that fertilizer will want to leech through the soil without anything capturing it."

> "The only thing I worry about using Blend in real cold weather climates is it has fertilizer in it and so you might not be getting the most for your money."

### Mistake #4: Expecting Compost Alone to Fertilize

> "What most people get wrong is compost isn't fertilizer... You expect when you use compost that everything turns green and healthy in a week or two. Well, that's not the case because compost is really fertilizer for soil."

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Soil Health and Relying on Chemical Fixes

> "If you rely on only synthetic fertilizer to feed trees, then you don't have the infrastructure in the soil there to [fight pests]."

> "Thatch builds up when you use mostly chemical fertilizer and you don't have a lot of life in your soil."

> "Until you fix this, no amount of watering, fertilizing, or even praying will save your landscape."

### Mistake #6: Using Weed-and-Feed Combination Products

> "Broadcasting weed killer while we broadcast fertilizer. It's easy. It's simple, but it's not the right way to do it. I would prefer to carefully select a fertilizer and then carefully select a weed killer based on what weed it is."

### Mistake #7: Applying Synthetic Fertilizer When Temperatures Are Wrong

> "You can throw all the synthetic fertilizer you want on there and if the temperatures are not warm enough it's not going to respond."

> "If you use too much of it, it's bad for the soil."

### The Organic Advantage: You Cannot Over-Apply

> "Don't worry, you don't need to be precise. You can't burn it and you can't over apply. So if you want to use twice that much, that's fine. We're giving you a rate at which we think you get your best value."

> "There's no such thing as too much -- it's just that you spend more money. But they won't burn. The more the better. It won't burn."

> "You can't overuse it. And you'll see that frequently with synthetic products that a lot of home gardeners damage lawn and plants with synthetic fertilizer, which is pretty easy to do when it's hot, and impossible to do with any of these products."

## 9. Quick-Reference Decision Tree

1. **Is it spring (soil 50-55F, air highs 70F+)?** -- Apply Nourish Biosol on lawns, Blend on everything else, Penetrate spray over all.
2. **Is it early summer?** -- Second application of Nourish Biosol on lawns; Blend on fruit trees and heavy feeders.
3. **Is it fall (Sept-Oct)?** -- Overseed lawns and apply Blend + Penetrate. Treat garden beds. Apply Blend through end of November in California.
4. **Is it winter (Nov-Dec)?** -- Apply Optimize only. It breaks down slowly and prepares soil for spring.
5. **Is your lawn sick?** -- Use Blend (not just Nourish Biosol) + Penetrate. Go heavy: 20-30 lbs Blend / 1000 sq ft.
6. **Are you planting something new?** -- Blend in the backfill, touching the roots. Spray Penetrate after planting.
7. **On a budget?** -- Optimize alone. Slow but effective. 3 lb bag covers 1,000 sq ft.
8. **Confused?** -- Just apply Blend. It is good for everything.
