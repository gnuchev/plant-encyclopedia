## 1. Climbing Rose Varieties

John selected six climbing varieties for a 252-ft block-wall installation, chosen "for their color, their size, their vitality, their adaptivity to our climate -- very hot summers":

| Variety | Notable Trait |
|---|---|
| **Don Juan** | Classic deep red climber |
| **Joseph's Coat** | Multi-color, shifts from red to orange to yellow |
| **Pretty in Pink** | Pink tones |
| **Golden Opportunity** | Yellow/gold |
| **Zephirine Drouhin** | Thornless old-garden rose, deep pink |
| **Lavender Crush** | Lavender -- had to be ordered from out of state |

> "There's one different variety next to each other six times and then we start the six over again."

> "What they're after is this kind of ... orgasmic mix of color, really spectacular. They have low roses in the foreground and then they have these big roses all up against the back and really vivid, bright colors."

**Sourcing note:** "The owner became convinced she wanted that Lavender Crush. I could not find it locally so one of the neat things about buying plants these days is you can go online and find Lavender Crush. So it came from another state, but I was able to find Lavender Crush. All the other roses I bought at local nurseries here in Fresno."

## 2. Trellis Building

A simple, inexpensive trellis system using welded wire on a block wall:

- **Material:** 16-ft long, 5-ft tall, heavy-gauge welded wire in 4x4-inch squares
- **Cost:** Approximately $25 per 16-ft panel (252 ft of wall total)
- **Paint color:** Benjamin Moore "Dragon's Breath" -- a dark, nondescript color
- **Attachment:** Eye hooks drilled into the block wall, spaced about every 8 ft, also painted Dragon's Breath

> "These are 16-ft long, 5-ft tall heavy-gauge welded wire in 4x4 squares. We found that stores like Home Depot and Lowe's have something similar but they're not as heavy a gauge a wire, and we like this heavy gauge cuz it gives a little bit of support to the fence and it's strong, and these roses over time get heavy."

> "If you build a wood trellis it's way more expensive."

> "We painted it a nondescript color that makes it not real noticeable and we used the Benjamin Moore color Dragon's Breath. You should hardly notice the wire, and eventually the roses will touch each other and you won't see the wire at all."

**Planting against the wall:** "You want to plant them as close to the wire as you can get ... on a block wall there's a footing and the footing is solid concrete and so you can't get any closer unless you want to damage the footing, which we don't want to do. These were planted right up next to the footing and then we tilt them a little. Over time you won't even notice the space because the trunks will get much bigger."

**Training:** "You don't have to go out there every day and help them twist around it, but you have to get them started so they'll latch onto that wire and then on their own they'll start to grab it and grow. And I like to use green horticultural tape -- we'll just tie the rose tendrils to the wire."

**Coverage timeline:** "I'd say about 3 years the wall will mostly be covered. In about 3 years you'll see much more climbing roses than wire."

## 3. Spacing

> "There's no hard and fast rule. They have to be spaced 10 ft -- that's just what we came up with here because they really wanted to use six different roses four times and so they had 252 feet, so the 10-ft spacing came out of that."

> "There's quite a variation in climbing rose sizes, so when you select the roses some don't get that big, some don't spread that much, some of these spread more. We kind of like the idea of them growing together and mixing together, so we're not worried about it."

## 4. Heavy Feeding: Blend + Penetrate

Roses are heavy feeders. John's protocol centers on two products applied together.

### What Is "Blend"?

A custom mix of three John and Bob's dry products:

> "When I feed roses what we do is we take the three dry products -- Soil Optimizer, Nourish Biosol, and Maximize -- and we have a mixture that we use on all our jobs. We use one part Soil Optimizer, two parts Nourish Biosol, three parts Maximize. So one, two, three -- it's easy to keep track of. We mix it together and we call it Blend."

**Ratio:** 1 part Soil Optimizer : 2 parts Nourish Biosol : 3 parts Maximize.

### Application Rate

> "I use three cups of Blend on a rose, like right after pruning."

> "A tremendous treatment for roses -- and we've tried this in different rose clubs -- we've gotten the best results with about three cups of Blend over the root zone of the rose and then spray over that with Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller."

### Enhanced Protocol (for pest/disease suppression)

> "You can add to that, if you continue to have any kind of pest or disease: you do the Blend and then do about an inch and a half to two inches of earthworm castings over the Blend. That combination feeds the rose but also does it in a way that limits things like aphid and white fly and all kinds of other pests."

> "That combination of Blend, Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller, and earthworm castings is the best thing I've come across for minimizing pest and disease and maximizing vitality of rose plants and the blooms."

### Foliar Application

Penetrate can also be sprayed directly on roses:

> "Over mature roses it's good to spray it on the canes, even on the leaves."

> "We're marketing it as to go on the soil, but you can spray it right on the rose."

### No Burn Risk

> "Is there any danger of over-usage and burning? ... In general you can't over-apply it, and really the more the better."

## 5. Foundation & Landscape Roses

John frequently uses low-maintenance shrub roses as foundation and landscape plants, particularly **Ice Cap** and **Iceberg**.

### Ice Cap (Dwarf Iceberg)

> "This is a really neat rose that's rated highly by all those people that rate roses. Ice Cap -- and it's very similar to Iceberg but it's smaller. Does great in our area. Does great in hot areas. It's a real good low-maintenance rose and doesn't get real big. And that's what I -- why I use it a lot. It stays what, about 3 ft tall. Doesn't get much taller than that."

> "Throughout the summer when our normal roses, our hybrid tea roses, are failing because of the excessive heat of July and August, the Ice Caps are blooming like crazy."

### Iceberg

> "You can see the contrast between Ice Cap and Iceberg. The Iceberg gets taller and has bigger flowers ... maybe a little too big for a lot of spots. And so that's why I use Ice Cap an awful lot. They both bloom more than once a year. When it's warm, they keep blooming. You can cut the dead blooms off and then they bloom again."

**Iceberg as tree rose:** "Iceberg roses grown as small trees" -- used as accent plantings. "Rose trees transplant very well."

### Other Landscape Roses

- **Marmalade Sky** (Floribunda): "These spectacular Marmalade Sky floribunda roses. One of my favorites. Really looking absolutely outstanding."
- **Rose types that thrive in tough conditions:** "Even when everything was dying here, they were still able to successfully grow roses ... tree roses, ground cover roses, hybrid tea roses, floribunda roses, almost every kind of rose there is in every color. ... Have heart -- if you can't grow anything else, even in terrible soil, usually you can grow roses as long as you don't overwater them and you try to give them a little bit of care."

## 6. Pruning Approach

### Hybrid Tea Roses -- Keep It Simple

> "Most people when they think of roses think of hybrid tea roses, which supposedly have all these rules around pruning and those rules can be intimidating for people and sometimes make it so people don't want a rose."

> "I once went to a rose pruning seminar and he said, 'If you don't know anything about roses and all you did is just grabbed it all and bunched it together and cut off two-thirds of it, you'd be doing great and the rose would respond fine. It wouldn't meet any of the very exacting standards of properly pruning hybrid tea rose, but it would perform great.'"

A rose expert reiterated the same advice years later:

> "A rose expert told me if all you did was grab the rose and cut off two-thirds of the leaves, you're fine for a home garden -- not maybe not for growing prize-winning roses."

### Climbing Roses -- Minimal Pruning

> "For climbing roses you don't do a lot of pruning because it's almost impossible to prune them once they get intertwined in the wire. But you can prune for width and so you might want to come and prune it to keep encouraging it to stay flat."

> "If you wanted to, you don't have to, but you can prune off old blooms, which is a lot of work. You probably do increase future blooms if you prune off dying blooms, but that's difficult to do on 250 feet long area of climbing roses."

### Pruning Timing (Fresno / Zone 9)

> "In the winter here in Fresno I don't like to prune the roses too early because sometimes we'll have a few days of unusually warm weather and if you've pruned them they start to bud and start to sprout too early. I usually do the pruning more in January and February, right before the weather is going to turn warm and we want them to sprout."

## 7. Organic Disease & Pest Management

### Rose and Soil Defender

A botanical spray product by John and Bob's for both fungal disease and insect pests:

> "For roses which tend to have sometimes both fungal disease and pests, we have a product called Rose and Soil Defender. And that can really be used on anything, but we called it Rose and Soil Defender cuz it's particularly effective on roses."

> "Rose and Soil Defender ... is got a bunch of botanicals in it and the whole premise of our products is similar to neem oil, in that all of them are organic pesticides. The idea of them is you don't have to be so worried about using them because they're good for the soil, they're actually good for the plant."

**When to apply:** "Most likely I wouldn't apply them in the spring unless I saw a problem. And usually in spring there's not a lot of pest and disease problems -- those develop as we get into warmer weather. I would only use them in the spring if I see an issue. They're more after-the-fact type products."

### Rose Weevil

> "A lot of times they don't know what it looks like, but you notice when your flowers bloom then there's something eating the flowers and that's Rose Weevil. Pretty frustrating and mostly prevalent on white and yellow roses. Now if you don't want to have Rose Weevil, plant deeply colored roses and you won't have Rose Weevil."

> "I think the best way to address Rose Weevil is to apply beneficial nematodes early in the spring."

### Rose Slugs & Sawflies

> "Rose slugs, sawflies -- those are most likely the same thing, they could be in different stages of the development. You can use the beneficial-bacteria-based organic pesticide called Spinosad."

> "In the early spring, why not apply beneficial nematodes? Then you can address Rose Weevil, Rose slugs, and sawflies."

### Aphids & Whitefly

> "The most harmless way to get rid of aphid and white fly -- the first thing to try is with a blast of water. Sometimes that'll work especially if it's not a major infestation."

> "My favorite way ... is to use our Blend around the root ball and then on top of the Blend use about 2 inches of earthworm castings, like Worm Gold Plus. Tremendously effective for white fly."

### Other Products

- **Citrol Blast** and **Enviro Repel 40** -- for fungal problems and general pest issues
- **Insecticidal soap** -- "considered one of the most non-toxic ways of trying to organically treat things"
- **Beneficial nematodes** -- from Arbico; multiple species available for different pests

### Soil-First Philosophy

> "The whole point of using our products and using things like earthworm castings and compost is they're all around building the soil, and the soil is the most effective and efficient way to keep your plants healthy."

## 8. Seasonal Care Calendar (Fresno / Zone 9)

| Season | Task |
|---|---|
| **January -- February** | Prune hybrid tea roses (cut off two-thirds). Do NOT prune too early -- wait until just before sustained warm weather so premature budding does not occur. |
| **Late January -- Early March** | Apply 3 cups Blend per rose over the root zone, immediately after pruning. Spray Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller over the Blend. Optionally add 2 inches earthworm castings on top. |
| **Early Spring** | Apply beneficial nematodes to soil to preemptively address Rose Weevil, rose slugs, and sawflies. |
| **Spring -- Summer** | Monitor for pests and disease. Apply Rose and Soil Defender only as needed -- "they're more after-the-fact type products." Deadhead shrub and floribunda roses to encourage repeat bloom. |
| **Summer (July -- August)** | Expect hybrid tea roses to struggle in extreme heat. Ice Cap and Iceberg roses continue blooming through peak summer. |
| **Fall** | Optional second application of Blend + Penetrate: "Depending on the success of the rose plant and the kinds of problems or the lack of problems that you have, I would probably do that same thing in the fall." |
| **Year-round** | For climbing roses, train new growth onto wire with green horticultural tape. Prune only for width to keep growth flat against the trellis. |
