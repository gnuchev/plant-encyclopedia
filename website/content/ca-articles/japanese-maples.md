## Why Japanese Maples Are Signature Trees for California Gardens

John Valentino returns to Japanese maples again and again across his videos -- in client gardens, in nursery recommendations, and in his own yard. They are his go-to when a garden needs structure, color, and elegance without the liabilities of a full-canopy shade tree.

> "If you are interested in Japanese maples, I'm going to talk about different sizes, colors, and leaf types."

> "That's one of the neat things about Japanese maples is they come in all sizes. You can get 25 to 30 foot and you can get dwarf ones that only get 3 to four to 5 ft tall."

> "There's probably what two three 400 varieties of Japanese maple."

He uses them as the entire organizing principle of a small-garden renovation in Fresno:

> "We're in Fresno in this small intimate little backyard that we just renovated with 10 different mostly dwarf Japanese maples. If you're looking for Japanese maples for your small garden, this is a great video."

And in his own yard, Japanese maples sit alongside crepe myrtles and hibiscus as core patio-scale trees:

> "That's why I've chosen in my yard a smaller yard trees like uh lagrass draia crepe myrtle, the hibiscus tree, some of the Japanese maples, you know, they come in different sizes. I like to talk a lot about patio scale trees."

## Upright vs. Weeping / Dissected Forms

John breaks Japanese maple growth habits into three main categories:

> "They vary in their growth habits, but the three main are upright, spreading, weeping, and everything in between those. Just like you would picture a weeping willow, that's what a weeping Japanese maple is."

**Leaf types** also divide into three groups:

> "The leaves are in three categories. A maple leaf, and then one what we might call a ribbon leaf, than one that seems like everybody wants, which is a lace leaf. And different variations of those three."

The finer the leaf, the more sun-sensitive the plant:

> "All of the leaves that are more finely divided and more delicate tend to be more sensitive to sun. And so you have to be more cognizant of its exposure. Make sure it doesn't get much or any afternoon sun."

**Weeping dwarf example -- 'Ryusei' (Rusi):**

> "As we go past the peeve starfish, we come on a very unusual one, which is a weeping dwarf maple, rusi. And that's really a neat habit. It'll almost act like a ground cover if you like it. I like maybe leaving it a little bit off the ground and enjoying its pendulus habit and thinning it out a little so you can see the structure of it. But it doesn't really get much taller than that because it starts weeping. But it will spread quite a bit."

**Dissected / Dissectum types:**

> "This is dissectum veridus. Most people just call it veridus. It's a small dwarf green, finely divided, dissected leaf. And again, it's going to spread out, not get too much taller than this."

---

## Dwarf Varieties (3-5 ft) vs. Standard (15-20+ ft)

John emphasizes the enormous size range as one of the key advantages of the species:

> "I'd say the smallest, there are some that only get 3 ft tall. I haven't seen any that stay smaller than that. And usually they'll show a range, but they grow very slowly. So, it's going to take a while to get to these ultimate sizes. 3 to 5t tall. That's a range of quite a few varieties. And then you can find quite a few varieties that are 5 to 8t tall and quite a few varieties that are 8 to 12 feet tall. And a lot of the more well-known varieties are 20 to 30 foot trees."

### Named Varieties John Uses

| Variety | Type | Mature Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dissectum** | Dwarf, spreading | ~3 ft tall | "Doesn't get taller than 3 ft. Won't get too much taller than it is now. Just spreads out." |
| **Dissectum Viridis** | Dwarf, green lace leaf | ~3 ft tall | "Small dwarf green, finely divided, dissected leaf." |
| **Tamukeyama** | Dwarf, weeping | Small | Used multiple times in the Fresno dwarf-maple garden. |
| **Shaina** (Acer palmatum 'Shaina') | Dwarf, upright, colored | Small | "Really spectacular colors. And already with a great form." |
| **Fireglow** | Dwarf | Small | "Another dwarf Japanese maple." Needs afternoon shade. |
| **Peeves Starfish** | Dwarf red | Small | "A dwarf red Japanese maple and doesn't get very big." Flanking a seating area. |
| **Ryusei (Rusi)** | Dwarf, weeping | Ground-cover height | Pendulous habit, spreads wide. |
| **Jo-en (Joeen)** | Mid-size, upright | 10-12 ft | "The only one in the whole collection here that is not really a dwarf. It gets about 10 to 12 feet tall." Name means "ladylike" in Japanese. |
| **Sango Kaku** | Standard, upright | ~25 ft | Known for vivid coral bark. "Beautiful bark adds to the attraction of the tree even in the winter when it doesn't have any leaves." |
| **Green Japanese Maple** (seedling/species type) | Standard, upright | 15-20 ft | Eddie's green maple at ~20 ft after 15-20 years; takes more sun than grafted colored types. |

For the small Fresno renovation, John chose exclusively from the dwarf end:

> "For this project, we're going to pick the ones that are in the 3 to 7 ft range. A couple of the bigger ones maybe will rely on some skillful pruning to keep them down to 5T or so."

> "We're going to spot in about nine of these dwarf Japanese maples. Underneath all of that, we're going to do an understory planting of juniper procumbent nana mixed with laapi varagata."

He contrasts the standard green one that Eddie has:

> "Eddie has one that we showed you earlier, green Japanese maple that's 20 feet tall and it's been his has been there a while. This one is only 3 to 5t tall, full size. So, it's a small, delicate, dwarf Japanese maple. And there's lots of different varieties that fit that same description."

## Sun Tolerance in Fresno Heat

Fresno summers routinely exceed 100 degrees F. John repeatedly addresses sun exposure as the critical limiting factor:

> "We know that these colorful Japanese maples with finely divided leaves need quite a bit of shade, afternoon shade. And so I'm a little uncertain how this is going to go with shade because it's hard to predict the sun patterns exactly. We know some of them will be fine and a couple of them might not be."

> "Depending on your environment, but especially in our area here in areas that have hot summers, you need to make sure you have the right exposure, especially these finely divided ones with color. They tend to get burned in the summer unless you can provide them some summer shade."

The **green species type** is the most sun-tolerant:

> "And even in Fresno, this green one takes quite a lot of sun."

> "Most of the more desirable varieties are grafted. Those grafted varieties usually have more finely divided leaves and usually they'll tolerate a little less Sun than just a green Japanese maple."

**Strategies John uses to provide shade in hot gardens:**

- Planting under existing canopy trees (Chinese pistache, camphor):
  > "We're going to use it as an understory plant under this Chinese pistache. And this Chinese pistache, we're hoping will branch out even more and give us some more shade."

- Using dwarf ginkos and other trees as partial shade providers:
  > "Again, needs some protection from afternoon sun. Eventually these ginkos will provide some, but we've got a big camper above us that it's going to help."

**Soil health as heat defense:**

> "Japanese maples and redwoods tend to suffer in Fresno summer with 100 degree heat and a lot of sun."

> "If we infuse them with life, they will take hot temperatures much more successfully."

> "Maples tend to like slightly moist soil particularly if they do get more sun than they should get. Uh so in the summer if you're trying to keep them looking good and not burning, then you want to make sure those roots stay moist."

## Pruning for Structure

John's pruning philosophy for Japanese maples is consistent: thin once a year to reveal the branching structure.

> "It does need some pruning to look its best so that you can kind of see through it and see the structure. You would need to thin it once a year definitely and usually that's enough."

On the Shaina maple he just installed:

> "I just thinned it out a little so we can see the structure a little bit."

On the weeping Ryusei:

> "I like maybe leaving it a little bit off the ground and enjoying its pendulus habit and thinning it out a little so you can see the structure of it."

He treats it the same way he prunes any specimen tree -- removing crossing branches, bottom branches, and anything broken:

> "We're just thinning it out removing uh bottom branches and major crossing branches and anything that's broken the same way you might prune a Japanese maple."

On a mature Japanese maple pruned more frequently for a courtyard:

> "Here's our Japanese maple pruned on a regular basis you can go back to our video that we did on pruning a Japanese maple and it's exactly like that that's exactly how we prune this one and by pruning it frequently like every six months or so you can keep it looking like this."

On a red Japanese maple installed to be visible through large windows:

> "We replaced it with a red Japanese maple which we're envisioning being pruned extensively so you can always kind of look through it out into the street."

## Non-Invasive Roots / Patio-Scale Use

One of John's strongest and most explicit endorsements:

> "Japanese maple is a nice choice because it's pretty easy to take care of. And even in Fresno, this green one takes quite a lot of sun, **doesn't have invasive roots**."

He repeatedly groups Japanese maples with other patio-scale trees that "behave themselves" near hardscape:

> "It'll get 20 ft tall. Some people don't consider that small, but for a tree that's a patio scale tree."

> "Patio scale trees like you have at your house next to your pool make it so that you can do lots of interesting things around those trees. They don't get too big for their spot. They don't damage neighboring paving and foundations. They behave themselves."

He contrasts them against oversized trees that wreck small properties:

> "Almost every normalsized tree, meaning 25 ft tall and wide or bigger is too big for a site like this."

> "Nothing makes a more highmaintenance landscape than inappropriately sized trees."

Dwarf varieties in particular can be used right alongside seating, walks, and small structures:

> "I have one on either side of this seating area and they're called peeves starfish. Again, a dwarf red Japanese maple and doesn't get very big."

## Shade Garden Combinations

John pairs Japanese maples with a consistent palette of shade-tolerant and low-growing companions:

**Groundcover layer beneath dwarf maples:**
- Juniperus procumbens 'Nana' (spreading juniper)
- Variegated Liriope
- Carex 'Ice Dance'

> "Underneath all of that, we're going to do an understory planting of juniper procumbent nana mixed with laapi varagata or maybe a few carrots uh ice dance or something similar."

> "The juniper's procumbent nana will spread and the variegated uh larapi will spread a little and you won't see so much bark and that'll be a neat effect with these Japanese maples kind of springing out of this ground cover."

**Hydrangeas under Japanese maples** -- a combination he encounters in multiple established gardens:

> "Walking under a red Japanese maple with hydrangeas getting ready to bloom."

> "A planting of hydrangeas aelas and a couple of Japanese maples."

**Screening plants used alongside maple collections:**
- Camellia sasanqua 'Setsugekka' -- tall, narrow, with large white flowers
- Osmanthus fragrans -- evergreen with intensely fragrant flowers

> "We screened the garage wall with chameleia sanka sets gekka which is kind of a tall narrow susan chameleia with a big white flower with a yellow center."

> "Osmanthis fragrance has a flower that isn't real noticeable visually, but in a scent standpoint, you smell something and you say, 'Oh boy, that's the most delightful smell I've smelled.' Some people describe it as apricot preserves or peach jam."

**Courtyard planting palette with Japanese maples:**

> "The idea of the courtyard is it will have things like Japanese maples and Eastern Redbud Lambs Ear and variegated liriope and special dwarf Nandina the smoked Bush."

## Where to Place Them in the Landscape

John uses Japanese maples in several distinct landscape roles:

### 1. Small backyard "mini arboretum"
The entire organizing concept for a small Fresno renovation -- a collection walk:

> "We're going to do it like a mini arboritum. They're all going to be different, dramatically different from each other. And that's kind of the theme of you walk through and you see this little mini collection of Japanese maples that all have different colors and different leaf shapes."

### 2. Understory beneath large canopy trees
Using the mid-size 'Jo-en' under a Chinese pistache:

> "We're going to use it as an understory plant under this Chinese pistache."

### 3. Next to windows for interior views
A red Japanese maple placed specifically for sight lines through glass:

> "We replaced it with a red Japanese maple which we're envisioning being pruned extensively so you can always kind of look through it out into the street and she has some prominent windows here that will allow you to see it."

### 4. Entry walks and front yards
John's own home garden and a 15-20 year old installation:

> "Then we walk under this really nice green Japanese maple which we planted originally. So you can see it's now 15 to 20 years old. Multi-trunk, really beautiful."

### 5. Flanking seating areas
Dwarf red maples on either side of an outdoor structure:

> "I have one on either side of this seating area and they're called peeves starfish."

### 6. Poolside and patio adjacency

> "Patio scale trees like you have at your house next to your pool make it so that you can do lots of interesting things around those trees."

### 7. Courtyards with fountains
Interior courtyard planting for a xeriscape-adjacent garden:

> "The idea of the courtyard is it will have things like Japanese maples and Eastern Redbud."

### 8. Asian-influenced garden design
A garden with Japanese lanterns and Asian theming:

> "Ed, have you noticed that Japanese maple over there in the corner behind the Japanese lantern? ... It's hard not to notice that contrast with the green and the lantern there. It's really looks that's just picture perfect."

## John's Personal Garden Examples

John references his own plantings repeatedly:

> "That's why I've chosen in my yard a smaller yard trees like uh lagrass draia crepe myrtle, the hibiscus tree, some of the Japanese maples."

He uses a dissected maple in a repaired pot against salvaged metalwork:

> "For the backdrop for my dissect maple that I put in a pot."

His design philosophy emphasizes keeping trees in proportion to the yard:

> "Nothing makes a more highmaintenance landscape than inappropriately sized trees."

## Seasonal Color & Bark Interest

Japanese maples earn their place across multiple seasons:

> "The leaf colors are tremendously beautiful and varied. You can find orange, purple, red, green, yellow, and the color is most noticeable in the spring and the fall."

> "The ones that are colored usually don't hold their color through the middle of the summer. They'll fade just because of the heat."

> "Red Japanese maples are just starting to show their red leaves."

**Bark as winter interest:**

> "Another fantastic variation with Japanese maples is the bark. Some are spectacular. Probably the best known is one called sango kaku... Japanese maple sango kaku has this beautiful bark adds to the attraction of the tree even in the winter when it doesn't have any leaves it has this vividly colored bark."

**Fall color buying tip:**

> "If you're interested in fall color fall is an excellent time to purchase your plants because you can see in the nursery their performance and it is possible to get a dud of a fall color plant that's even known for great fall color but sometimes they don't have great fall color."

---

## Soil & Planting Care

John emphasizes biological soil health as the foundation for maple success in hot climates:

> "The other thing that we did here that I think is important with Japanese maples is taking great care to infuse the back fill when you do the planting with beneficial microbiological life."

> "If we infuse them with life, they will take hot temperatures much more successfully."

> "Look at that red maple behind us. A big reason why it's so spectacular is because of healthy soil. And it's that healthy soil that is the key to simplifying everything about gardening."

> "We don't want the maple to burn in the summer."

On watering:

> "Maples tend to like slightly moist soil particularly if they do get more sun than they should get. Uh so in the summer if you're trying to keep them looking good and not burning, then you want to make sure those roots stay moist."

On mature water needs:

> "I wouldn't necessarily consider that low water use, but when it gets big and with wellestablished roots, it's uh moderate."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Size range is the superpower.** From 3 ft dwarfs to 30 ft standards, there is a Japanese maple for every garden scale.
2. **Green species types tolerate Fresno sun.** Colored and lace-leaf grafted varieties need afternoon shade.
3. **Thin once a year** to reveal branching structure; prune every six months for tighter courtyard specimens.
4. **Roots are non-invasive** -- safe next to patios, pools, walks, and foundations.
5. **Build soil biology** at planting time and keep roots moist through summer to prevent burn.
6. **Buy in fall** to evaluate actual color performance at the nursery.
7. **Plant in groups** for a mini-arboretum effect, or as single specimens framed by windows and seating.
8. **Companion plants:** Juniperus procumbens 'Nana', variegated liriope, hydrangeas, azaleas, Camellia sasanqua, Osmanthus fragrans.
