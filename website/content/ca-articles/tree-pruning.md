## Philosophy: Why Pruning Matters

John Valentino considers improper pruning one of the greatest abuses inflicted upon trees. His philosophy centers on the idea that trees are among the most valuable assets in any landscape, and pruning should serve to reveal and enhance their natural beauty -- never to diminish it.

> "Mature trees in a well landscaped yard increase home values by 7 to 19% and that's by records of home sales. They also remove pollutants and sequester carbon." -- John Valentino

> "One of the worst abuses I see of trees is pruning. What we're trying to do with proper pruning, which is mostly thinning, is encouraging these trees to get big and mature because that's when they maximize their ability to do everything they can do for us." -- John Valentino

The core philosophy can be summarized:

- **Trees grow more valuable over time.** As they mature, they provide more shade, more energy savings, more property value, and more beauty. Pruning should support this trajectory, not undermine it.
- **Reveal the structure.** A well-pruned tree lets you see its trunk and branching architecture. As Valentino puts it: "Trees are a lot more attractive if you can see their structure. That happens to be really healthy for them, too."
- **Thinning over heading back -- always.** The single most important pruning principle is using thinning cuts rather than heading back cuts. This preserves the tree's natural form and structural integrity.
- **Less is more.** Go slowly, prune less than you think you need to, and keep stepping back to evaluate.

> "You see these trees kind of look like a ball of green leaves and you can't get a sense of the structure of the tree. My contention is trees are a lot more attractive if you can see their structure." -- John Valentino

> "No longer big balls of green or greenish gray. Now you can see the structure. They look like trees coming into their own." -- John Valentino

## The Fundamental Distinction: Thinning Cuts vs. Heading Back Cuts

This is THE essential concept in John Valentino's pruning philosophy. Understanding this one distinction will transform how you approach every tree and shrub in your garden.

### Thinning Cuts (The Right Way)

A thinning cut removes an entire branch back to its point of origin -- where it connects to the trunk or to a larger parent branch.

> "The proper cut is we're going to go all the way back to where this branch starts. And so this is a thinning cut where we remove the branch entirely and we go very close to the main trunk. We make a nice simple cut." -- John Valentino

Key principles of thinning cuts:

- **Remove the entire branch** back to where it originates
- **Cut close to the trunk or parent branch**, but not flush -- leave a small stub that will heal over
- **Preserve the tree's natural form** -- thinning allows the remaining branches to display the tree's inherent beauty
- **Each tree remains unique** -- thinning reveals individual character rather than imposing a uniform shape

### Heading Back Cuts (The Wrong Way for Most Trees)

A heading back cut chops a branch somewhere in the middle, leaving a stub.

> "A wrong kind of cut on this would be a heading back cut where we say, 'Oh, we want to lift this up, so we're going to cut this branch in half and get rid of part of it.'" -- John Valentino

> "The one thing I would say not to do is cut branches in half. That's called heading back. Instead of heading back, we're going to be thinning." -- John Valentino

Why heading back cuts are destructive on trees:

- **Weak regrowth:** Under heading back cuts, "sprouts all kinds of new growth. And that new growth, if it's in the middle of a big branch, is very weakly attached. And so now it becomes a dangerous tree."
- **Loss of natural form:** "If you're doing heading back cuts, you're creating trees that all look alike. They just look like a big blob on top of a trunk."
- **Structural danger:** The new sprouts that emerge below heading back cuts have poor attachment to the parent branch, creating a long-term hazard.

> "We're doing a disservice to the trees and a disservice to us." -- John Valentino

### The Important Exception: Shrubs

Heading back cuts are acceptable -- and sometimes preferable -- on shrubs, as opposed to trees.

> "Heading back cuts on a shrub like this are fine, unlike a tree. So we're not always real concerned about the origin." -- John Valentino

For large shrubs like podocarpus, privet, or xylosma used as screens and hedges, heading back cuts are a normal part of maintenance. The distinction is critical: **trees get thinning cuts; shrubs can handle heading back cuts.**

## Why Wound Sealant and Tree Paint Are Harmful

John Valentino is emphatic about this debunked practice. Despite products still being sold at hardware stores and garden centers, wound sealants and tree paints cause more harm than good.

> "It's marketed as a way to help your trees heal after pruning, but in reality, it slows recovery and causes them to be more likely to be diseased." -- John Valentino

> "This has been known for a long time and yet it persists that you can go into hardware stores and garden centers and buy special paint or black pitch or tar. And the idea is 'I want to protect those cuts' and that's just completely wrong and completely unproductive and completely problematic." -- John Valentino

### What Actually Happens When You Apply Sealant

- **Cracks form** in the sealant over time, creating sheltered spaces where insects can nest
- **The environment under the sealant** actually encourages pests and disease -- the opposite of what you want
- **Healing is slowed**, not helped

### What You Should Do Instead

> "What we want to do is make really nice smooth cuts in exactly the right places. And those smooth cuts exposed to air and everyday weather heal over the best without any paint." -- John Valentino

> "Some people seem to think it's a good idea to put some kind of pruning compound on the larger cuts. Don't do it. The best way is to make nice straight flat cuts and allow them to be subject to the air and good circulation and they'll heal on their own." -- John Valentino

The prescription is simple: **make clean cuts, leave them exposed to air, and let the tree heal naturally.**

## Proper Tree Staking Techniques

Staking is closely related to pruning because both serve the same goal: developing a strong, self-supporting tree. John and his son Chip Valentino ("vice president in charge of proper staking") consider this a critical topic.

### Why Nursery Stakes Must Be Removed

Trees from the nursery come with a single stake tied directly to the trunk. This is necessary for the nursery to sell straight trees, but it is harmful long-term.

> "What happens if you were to leave that stake on the tree? It's tied directly to the trunk. It inhibits the movement of the tree. And it's that very movement that allows trees to develop the kind of tensile strength starting at the bottom right around the soil that will allow them to stand on their own over time." -- John Valentino

### The Goal: Tensile Strength

> "Tensile strength is when the trunk is wider at its base than it is 1, 2, and 3, and 4 feet high. And that really is our goal. We don't want trees that are permanently staked. We want trees that after a year or two, all stakes can be removed." -- John Valentino

### Proper Staking Method

1. **Remove the nursery stake** that is tied directly to the trunk
2. **Use two stakes** (or three for trees that fall over with just two), driven into the ground on either side of the tree
3. **Use flexible tree ties** in a **figure-eight pattern** between each stake and the trunk
4. **Orient the stakes perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction** -- "not where the wind blows into one of the stakes but stakes on either side of the tree and then the wind comes, because that way you can get the most movement and that's what you want"
5. **Place the ties about 6 inches below the top of the stakes** -- to find the right height, "grab it with your hand and wherever you can hold it and have it stand up straight, you go 6 inches above that and that's where you put the ties"
6. **Both stakes should be exactly the same height** for a professional look
7. **Additional ties lower on the trunk** can straighten minor curves if needed

### The Critical Factor: Movement

> "If anyone asks you what's the most important thing in staking, how do you stake a tree properly -- the most important factor is movement. So we want to stake the tree so that it's allowed to move when the wind blows." -- John Valentino

> "I guess very similar to raising kids -- we want them to stand on their own. But not the kids, it takes more than 2 years. With the tree we can usually do it in a couple of years." -- John Valentino

### When to Remove Stakes

- **After 1-2 years**, the trunk should have developed enough tensile strength (visibly wider at the base, tapering upward)
- **Look for the taper** -- if the trunk is noticeably wider at the bottom than higher up, it is developing strength
- **Multi-trunk trees** (fruitless olives, crepe myrtles) generally do not need staking because they lack the "tall thin trunk with a bunch of weight on top" that creates instability
- **It is always better** for a tree not to need staking at all -- "it's much healthier for the tree"

---

## Step-by-Step Pruning Approach

John Valentino demonstrates a methodical approach to pruning any tree, whether young or mature. Here is his process distilled into actionable steps.

### Step 1: Assess the Tree

Stand back and study the overall form before making any cuts. Identify:

- Dead wood
- Crossing branches
- Low branches that need removal to raise the canopy
- Dense interior sections that need light
- The direction you want growth to go (usually up)

### Step 2: Start Low -- Remove the Lowest Small Branches

> "The very lowest small branches I'm going to remove. Some are on the inside, some are on the outside... I want to remove all of these small branches that are down low cuz I'm trying to raise up the growth in general." -- John Valentino

> "By getting all of these out, it allows me to see the whole thing a lot better and then I can get in easier and continue." -- John Valentino

### Step 3: Remove Crossing Branches

> "This is a small branch crossing this major branch. We don't want that. We don't want a crossing branch. So, we'll take this small one out as close to its origination. Not right up to it. You leave a little bit and it heals over, but pretty close." -- John Valentino

### Step 4: Thin the Interior

Open up the center of the tree to let in light and air, but do not clear-cut the middle:

> "I've definitely got the middle opened up. And yet I still have some little branches in there. And I like that. I don't want to clear cut it in the middle." -- John Valentino

### Step 5: Make Preliminary Cuts on Heavy Branches (Three-Cut Method)

For heavy branches, do NOT make a single cut at the point of origin. The weight will cause tearing.

> "When you have heavy branches, if I start out with a cut right there, because of the weight of the branch a lot of times when I try to cut it, it'll tear and I won't get a nice clean cut. So a good technique is to make an initial cut that just removes the weight of the branch, and then you can come back and make your final cut very clean and it won't tear because there's no weight on it." -- John Valentino

The technique:

1. **First cut:** Make a preliminary cut 1-3 feet out from where you want the final cut, removing the bulk of the weight
2. **Final cut:** Now make your clean thinning cut at the branch origin without any tearing risk

### Step 6: Direct Growth Upward

> "We're going to pick branches that are going up and remove branches that are going to the side. All of those cuts are going to be thinning cuts where we go to where the branch originates and cut it off completely." -- John Valentino

> "By removing the weight on the end, we can get them to grow up. You can see as we remove weight, the branches lift." -- John Valentino

### Step 7: Step Back, Evaluate, Repeat

> "The other thing that I think is good advice is to go relatively slow and prune less than you think you want to prune and keep stepping back and looking at it, cuz it's easy to get too enthusiastic and then you go back and you've got this improperly bare tree." -- John Valentino

> "We have these principles. We don't want to go by them 100% or otherwise if we see something that violates every rule, we could create a very bare looking tree. So, we want to kind of do it judiciously and with some calm, not in a frenzy." -- John Valentino

### Step 8: Preserve Enough Foliage

> "I don't want to take so many leaves off that we don't have enough to feed the tree because it's leaves that photosynthesize and actually feed the tree to allow it to continue to grow." -- John Valentino

---

## Raising the Canopy and Removing Crossing Branches

Two of the most common and most impactful pruning tasks.

### Raising the Canopy

"Raising the canopy" means removing lower branches so the leafy portion of the tree starts higher up. This:

- Creates room to walk under the tree
- Allows understory plantings to receive light
- Makes the tree look more refined and intentional
- Gives visual access through and around the garden

> "I want to raise the level of this tree a little bit. I want to get rid of some of this growth that's real low, especially since we've got other shrubs growing under it. Bring it in a little bit so it's not sprawling out. Take out the dead wood and I want to thin it a little bit to where you can just slightly better get a sense on what's on the other side." -- John Valentino

> "We're just trying to raise the canopy level so it doesn't look like a big shrub." -- John Valentino

### Removing Crossing Branches

Crossing branches rub against each other, creating wounds, blocking light, and cluttering the interior. Every crossing branch is a candidate for removal.

> "This is a small branch crossing this major branch. We don't want that... it's crossing with this main branch that I'm going to keep, and it goes in the middle. I'm going to take it off." -- John Valentino

> "We don't want crossing branches and we want to open things up." -- John Valentino

When choosing which crossing branch to remove, keep the one that:
- Grows in a better direction (usually upward)
- Is stronger and better positioned
- Contributes to the overall balanced shape of the tree

---

## Summer Pruning to Control Growth

John Valentino regularly prunes in summer heat -- even when temperatures exceed 100 degrees F in Fresno. His approach uses the biology of the tree against itself to control size.

### The Science of Summer Pruning

> "Even though it's over 100 degrees today, there's nothing wrong with pruning when it's hot. As long as you don't prune excessively. If you prune excessively, then that heat can damage a tree. But if you prune properly, there's nothing wrong with pruning when it's hot." -- John Valentino

> "More important how you prune than when you prune. Although the timing of the pruning can serve to either encourage growth or discourage growth." -- John Valentino

### How It Works

> "Right now we've just had spring here, so they've put on all kinds of growth. The purpose of that growth is through photosynthesis to feed more growth. And so if we come and we prune off a lot of that new growth, then we're kind of tricking the plant into defeating its mechanism for growing more. And these trees, we don't want them to get too much bigger. So this is a good time to prune." -- John Valentino

### Timing Rules of Thumb

- **Prune after leaf-drop (winter)** if you want the tree to **grow more** next season -- this is ideal for young trees you want to size up
- **Prune in late spring/summer** after the tree has fully leafed out if you want to **slow and control growth** -- this removes the foliage the tree invested energy in producing, limiting its ability to fuel further growth
- **Deciduous fruit trees** are typically pruned in winter months "right up until early spring"
- **For roses in Fresno:** "I don't like to prune the roses too early because sometimes we'll have a few days of unusually warm weather and if you've pruned them they start to bud and start to sprout too early. I usually do the pruning more in January and February."

## Renovation Pruning for Overgrown Trees and Shrubs

John Valentino frequently takes on gardens with overgrown, neglected plantings. His approach to renovation pruning applies the same core principles as pruning a newly planted tree.

> "Chip and I are here at this really small little yard with overgrown trees and shrubs. We've had questions regarding pruning existing mature plants, thinking that the pruning process was completely different than on a new plant. In actuality the pruning process is pretty much the same." -- John Valentino

### The Renovation Approach

1. **Assess what to keep, what to remove, and what to transplant:** "Try to do it without really butchering them. If there's a way to prune them where you can still keep them looking like nice shrubs with a nice form, that would be your first goal. Always consider transplanting."
2. **Remove dead and damaged wood first**
3. **Remove branches encroaching on the house, roof, or walkways:** "We had some dead growth on these poplar trees so we pruned... prune any dead branches out, lift them up so they're not on the roof."
4. **Thin large trees** to make them look "under control, nothing's overgrown, nothing's dead and dying"
5. **For olive trees and similar:** "They thinned it and made it look like a tree instead of a big ball."

### Reviving an Overgrown Olive Tree

> "Now you can see the structure of it -- so we thinned it and made it look like a tree instead of a big ball." -- John Valentino

### Pruning Overgrown Abelia and Similar Shrubs

John tells a memorable story about discovering the secret to lush abelia:

> "One time I was walking around with a customer in their garden and they had maybe 15 abelias. I wasn't looking where I was going and I tripped on one of them... and I broke it. I go back 6 months later and it's the best looking abelia of all of them because it sprouted right under where I kicked it and broke it and came out very densely and lushly." -- John Valentino

> "It takes no skill to prune them. You could kick them if you want... you just cut these branches back down to about where you think you might want them and they'll sprout under those cuts." -- John Valentino

For abelia specifically: prune after blooming, once a year, and feed with soil amendments.

## Species-Specific Pruning Tips

### Non-Fruiting Olive Trees

Olives are one of John Valentino's most frequently demonstrated pruning subjects. The technique showcases all core principles.

- Use **thinning cuts exclusively** -- remove branches entirely back to their origin
- **Raise the canopy** by removing lower branches
- **Remove crossing branches** and interior clutter
- **Open the center** to reveal trunk structure and let light through
- Prune to **direct growth upward**: "We want these to get a lot taller. So, we're going to pick branches that are going up and remove branches that are going to the side."
- **Remove suckers** from the base: "You can see they get a lot of sucker growth -- just have to continually cut those suckers off because we want to see those beautiful trunks."
- Thin once a year to maintain the refined look

### Japanese Maples

Japanese maples are pruned similarly to other trees but with special care given their delicate branching.

- Prune using the **same thinning principles** as any other tree: "The same way you might prune a Japanese maple... thinning it out, removing bottom branches and major crossing branches and anything that's broken."
- Can be pruned **every six months** to maintain a refined look
- Come in an **incredible range of sizes** (3 feet to 30 feet) -- choose the right variety for your space rather than fighting size with excessive pruning
- Growth habits include upright, spreading, and weeping forms
- "Will rely on some skillful pruning" for varieties that might outgrow their space
- A red Japanese maple can be "pruned extensively so you can always kind of look through it" -- the goal is transparency and structure

### Crepe Myrtles

Crepe myrtles are a staple of California Central Valley landscapes and come in many sizes.

- **Indian Tribe varieties** (Tuscarora, Muskogee, Natchez) are large -- "big crepe myrtles... they have these big plumes of flowers... this makes an excellent small shade tree"
- **Black Diamond series** are smaller (about 10 feet) with red leaves -- good for confined spaces
- **Multi-trunk crepe myrtles do not need staking** because "they don't have a tall thin trunk with a bunch of weight on top"
- Crepe myrtles need **thinning** at least once a year: "It doesn't require a lot of pruning, but to make it look like Eddie's here, it needs thinning. I'd say at least once a year."
- **Light pruning is good for the bloom** -- "even like crepe myrtle trees... light pruning is good for the bloom"
- Prune **after leaf drop in winter** if you want them to grow more; prune in summer to control size
- Valentino's emphasis on thinning cuts (not heading back) is an implicit rejection of "crepe murder" -- the common practice of topping crepe myrtles into ugly stumps

### Fruit Trees (Peach, Apricot, Citrus, Apple, Fig)

- Fruit trees use **different methods** than ornamental trees: "Fruiting trees we'd probably use a little different methods."
- Deciduous fruit trees are **pruned in the winter months right up until early spring**
- Prune for **shape and production**: "We pruned it for shape and production and we hope to lower the fruit a little."
- Keep fruit trees **relatively small** so you can pick them: "A lot of fruit trees you keep relatively small so you can pick them, so you're not after big broad spreading trees."
- On fruit trees, **always remove suckers**: "We usually recommend on fruit trees going around looking for suckers, any dead branches and stuff that's not growing right and just clip them."
- **Citrus:** "For citrus I like to do not much." Keep them healthy with good soil and let them grow naturally. Annual pruning is minimal.
- **Fig trees:** Can be pruned aggressively; they respond well to hard cuts
- **Apples and stone fruit:** Can control size through pruning: "Through pruning we can control it -- I'd say we can keep this about 10 ft and the others maybe 6 to 8 ft."

### Lemon Trees (Espalier/Arbor Form)

- Lemon arbors need **once-a-year pruning and tying**
- Use **horticultural green tape** for tying branches -- "that's pretty good for branches. If you use anything heavier that doesn't have give, then it digs into the branches."
- **Select upright shoots** and bend them over to create the arbor shape
- Prune everything that doesn't contribute to the arbor form

### Roses

- **Landscape roses** (ground cover types, shrub roses): Minimal pruning -- "just kind of cutting off the dead flowers and making them be the shape and the size you want them to be"
- **Hybrid tea roses:** Require specialized pruning, but don't be intimidated: "If you don't know anything about roses and all you did is just grabbed it all and bunched it together and cut off two-thirds of it, you'd be doing great and the rose would respond fine."
- In Fresno, prune roses in **January and February**, not too early in winter

### Herbs (Rosemary, Oregano, etc.)

- "Cut it back once a year, which encourages new growth. And it's that new growth that really is very useful to us as being flavorful."
- "When it's done blooming is a nice time to prune it."
- Woody herbs like rosemary: "you can prune out dead wood"
- Harvest and prune around the **first bloom** when "their fragrance and their flavor maximizes"

### Privacy Screens (Privet, Xylosma, Podocarpus)

- These large evergreen shrubs tolerate heading back cuts well
- Privet: "If you never pruned a privet it would probably get 10 ft wide, 20 to 25 ft tall. Now we're keeping it 4 or 5 ft wide, 7 ft tall -- that requires two or three times a year pruning."
- Podocarpus macrophyllus: Very low maintenance, may only need pruning once every few years unless space is tight
- When pruning screens: "I still like to prune back to some kind of a small bud or branch and then it'll grow up."

## Tools You Need

John Valentino keeps his tool list simple and emphasizes quality above all.

### Essential Pruning Tools

- **Hand pruning shears** (good quality) -- the workhorse tool for most pruning work: "A lot of this work can be done with hand pruning shears."
- **Loppers** -- large pruning shears operated with two hands, for branches too thick for hand shears: "Some people call these loppers."
- **Pruning saw** -- for larger branches that loppers cannot handle: "If the trees were bigger, we might need a pruning saw."
- **Pole pruners** -- for reaching the upper portions of trees without a ladder: "We're going to use the pole pruners as a convenient way of pruning the top part of the tree, but we're going to use the same principles."

### General Garden Tools (Valentino's Essentials)

- A broom
- Hard rake and leaf rake
- Shovels of different sizes, including hand shovels
- A **sharpshooter** (combination digging bar and shovel) -- "There's no tool in our own work that we use more than what we call a sharpshooter."
- Good quality hand shears and loppers

### Tool Quality and Maintenance

> "In all cases, invest in good quality tools and they'll last you a long time and they'll allow you to do a really good job." -- John Valentino

- Avoid "as seen on TV" pruners: "usually low quality and break easily"
- **Sanitizing pruning shears** is only necessary when pruning diseased trees: "I only recommend sanitizing pruning shears if you're pruning trees with some kind of disease. In this case, we have perfectly healthy trees. No need to worry about that."

## Common Pruning Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Heading Back Cuts on Trees

This is the number one mistake and the hill John Valentino will die on.

> "Improper pruning where we're doing heading back cuts is terrible for trees and violates this rule of trying to get them as big as possible and as properly shaped as possible so they can maximize their value." -- John Valentino

> "If you have a big oak, beautiful oak tree, and you head it back, you really cause problems for the tree down the road because under the cuts sprouts all kinds of new growth. And that new growth, if it's in the middle of a big branch, is very weakly attached. And so now it becomes a dangerous tree." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 2: Applying Wound Sealant or Tree Paint

> "By using those products, they tend to develop cracks in them, which are spaces for insects to nest. And so we end up with these environments that actually encourage pests and disease." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 3: Leaving the Nursery Stake On

> "You get your tree from the nursery with this stake usually tied directly to it and that really isn't good for the tree." -- John Valentino

If left in place, the nursery stake prevents the trunk from developing tensile strength, creating a tree permanently dependent on support.

### Mistake 4: Pruning Too Aggressively

> "Go relatively slow and prune less than you think you want to prune and keep stepping back and looking at it, cuz it's easy to get too enthusiastic and then you go back and you've got this improperly bare tree. It's best to do it in stages and keep looking at it." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 5: Removing Too Many Leaves

> "I don't want to take so many leaves off that we don't have enough to feed the tree because it's leaves that photosynthesize and actually feed the tree to allow it to continue to grow." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Suckers

Suckers growing at the base of the trunk steal energy from the tree's canopy and should be removed regularly.

> "You definitely want to go around and look for suckers which are always at the bottom of the trunk... got to make sure you cut them so that way all the energy of the tree goes up to the branches." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 7: Not Making Preliminary Cuts on Heavy Branches

Cutting a heavy branch in one pass at the trunk often results in bark tearing. Always remove the weight first.

> "A good technique is to make an initial cut that just removes the weight of the branch, and then you can come back and make your final cut very clean and it won't tear because there's no weight on it." -- John Valentino

### Mistake 8: Staking Incorrectly (or Not at All)

- Stakes oriented in the wrong direction (into the wind rather than perpendicular to it)
- Rigid ties that prevent movement
- Leaving stakes on indefinitely
- Not staking at all when the tree needs support, leading to crooked growth

### Mistake 9: Pruning at the Wrong Time for Your Goal

If you want a tree to grow bigger, prune in winter dormancy. If you want to control size, prune in late spring/summer after the growth flush. Getting this backward works against your objectives.

### Mistake 10: Excessive Pruning in Extreme Heat

> "There's nothing wrong with pruning when it's hot. As long as you don't prune excessively. If you prune excessively, then that heat can damage a tree." -- John Valentino

## Quick Reference: Pruning Decision Guide

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Branch crossing another | Remove the weaker/worse-positioned branch (thinning cut) |
| Low branches blocking walkway | Remove entirely at origin (thinning cut to raise canopy) |
| Dead wood | Remove entirely |
| Dense interior, no light penetration | Thin selectively to open up |
| Tree too wide, arching over | Prune back to an upward-growing branch or bud |
| Suckers at trunk base | Remove completely |
| Heavy branch to remove | Make preliminary cut to remove weight, then final clean cut |
| Overgrown shrub | Same principles as trees; heading back is acceptable on shrubs |
| Want tree to grow more | Prune in winter dormancy |
| Want to slow/control growth | Prune in late spring/summer |
| After making any pruning cut | Leave exposed to air -- NO sealant, paint, or tar |
