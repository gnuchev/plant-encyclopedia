## Overview: The Philosophy of Dog-Proof Landscaping

John Valentino approaches dog-friendly landscaping as a dual-purpose design challenge -- the yard must work for the dog *and* the humans who live there. His team at John and Bob's Corporation has developed a practical toolkit of strategies drawn from real client projects, most memorably the yard of a dog named Petey.

> "We wanted to dogproof the yard and make it attractive and easy to care for and useful for humans at the same time. That's the idea of gardens and landscapes is to enjoy them and have them improve your life."

## Petey's Yard Transformation: A Case Study

The most detailed dog-proofing project in John's catalog centers on a yard that had been destroyed by a dog named Petey. The lawn was gone, the irrigation was damaged, and the owners needed a complete rethink.

> "This yard was dramatically impacted by their dog, Petey. He made it so the lawn disappeared because of digging. The owners hired us to make it a low-maintenance dogproof yard."

John introduces the project with humor, crediting his own dog Chip as a staff member:

> "I'm John Valentino, president of John Bob's Corporation. This is Chip Valentino, who's vice president in charge of pet landscaping. He has a GoPro camera today. Stay tuned so you can see a dog's perspective."

The transformation addressed every major dog-related yard problem: destroyed lawn, torn-up irrigation, muddy paws, digging, and urine damage. Each solution is documented below.

## Artificial Turf: Pros, Cons, and the Heat Problem

John is transparent that he is generally *not* a fan of artificial turf, but he acknowledges specific scenarios where it makes sense -- particularly for dog owners.

### When It Works

> "While I'm not usually a proponent of artificial turf, there are some cases where it makes sense and it's a good choice. This is one of them."

The benefits for dog yards are significant:

> "The benefits of artificial turf in this case really add up. Nice shock of green. Stays clean and neat. Dog loves it. Dog can't dig in it. Doesn't need mowing. Doesn't need watering. Doesn't need fertilizing."

> "I like that if you're using something not just for looks, and in this case, the dog is using this lawn every day."

### Urine Management on Artificial Turf

One of the strongest arguments for artificial turf in dog yards is that urine management becomes simple:

> "With a regular lawn, you can get pet stains in the summer. Very, very common. People think they have fungus, but it's pet urine stains. For dog urine, you rinse it off as frequently as you want. And then there is a method to actually once a year or so give it a better cleaning. You can keep it very clean without a lot of effort."

### The Heat Problem (Critical for Fresno / Central Valley / Hot Climates)

This is the single biggest downside, and John does not sugarcoat it:

> "One of the biggest downsides of artificial turf, especially in a city like Fresno that's over 100 degrees many days in the summer, is the heat. It's a hot surface."

From a separate artificial turf installation video, John reinforces this concern at a philosophical level:

> "I'm not a fan of artificial turf and one big reason is because of where we are in a very hot area and artificial turf is hot. I think we should be doing things to cool our City not to make it hotter."

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. **Shade trees.** In Petey's yard, large existing shade trees (pacarpus, sycamore) made the turf viable:
   > "In this case, we have these big shade trees, pacarpus, sycamore. So, it's a cooler yard and it's a shaded yard. And in the absence of sun beating down on it, the heat problem isn't as big a factor."

2. **Sprinklers over the turf.** For yards without adequate shade:
   > "Some people choose to put in sprinklers. On a hot summer day, you can turn on the sprinklers, cool it off."

   From the installation video:
   > "We've been hired in the past to install sprinklers on artificial turf because the turf gets so hot in the summer... on a hot day if the kids are going to play on the lawn you can just turn on the sprinklers for a minute or two or three, cool off the turf, and it's a way of keeping it cool."

### Installation and Longevity

From the installation tutorial, the proper base is:

> "We took out 4 in of top soil with the lawn... and then we replaced that with 3 in of base rock... and 1 in of decomposed granite... and we compacted the 3 in by itself and then we compacted the 1 in of decomposed Granite on top of the base Rock."

The infill sand matters, especially for pet households:

> "This particular sand that we're using in this one has antimicrobial and antibacterial coatings on there to prevent mold and prevent mildew as well, particularly if there's going to be kids or pets playing around."

**Maintenance for pet owners:**

> "If you're going to be having pets, recommended to hose it down at least once a week."

**Expected lifespan:**

> "Synthetic Turf nowadays is lasting you anywhere from 15 to 20 years. There's some turfs that will last you in the 22, 25 year range depending on how you're using it, where it's installed, depending on the heat."

### The Bottom Line on Artificial Turf for Dogs

> "So, if you have a dog and you want a lawn, an artificial turf is a simpler, easier thing to consider that might work good for you."

## 3/4" Rock: The Anti-Digging Strategy

This is one of John's most specific and practical recommendations. Rock size matters -- and most people use rock that is too small.

> "Does your dog walk into your house with muddy paws or covered in dirt? We have a couple of tricks to solve that frustrating reality. One of the important things we did is instead of using mulch or leaving it dirt all around the plants, we used a 3/4 in rock. That makes it so he doesn't seem to want to dig in the rocks. And Petey has a reputation for digging."

> "Chip, the angel that he is, doesn't do much digging."

### Why Size Matters: 3/4" vs 3/8"

> "One thing that's important there is to make those rocks big enough. There's a lot of gravel or rock being used in landscapes that's 3/8 and they still tend to dig in that. But if you can make it 3/4 and bigger, that seems to not prohibit them but discourage them from digging in it."

### Rock Selection and Application

John used a decorative rock called "Rainbow" in Petey's yard:

> "There's lots of different rocks available. This is an attractive one called Rainbow. And we used it everywhere we could use it."

**Thickness -- don't overdo it:**

> "And we didn't put it real thick because if you don't put it real thick, I think it's good for soil, good for the plants under the rock."

**Soil improvement still works through rock:**

> "We used our products to improve that soil and put life in the soil. And then down the road as we want to make improvements to the soil, we can just throw it on top of the rock and it'll go right through the rock."

**No weed fabric under planted areas:**

> "The other thing is I don't like using weed fabric under the rock if we have plants. If it's in an area where you're just going to use as a walk, then that's fine."

**Rock works for any plant:**

> "If you're considering rock as a mulch, don't worry about that as a decision. That will work fine. Any plant can have rock around it."

## Buried Drip Irrigation: Dog-Proof Watering

Dogs that chew and break above-ground irrigation are a common problem. John's solution is straightforward: bury everything.

> "The dog's prone to chewing on or breaking irrigation things that are above grade -- sprinklers and valves and such. You can't see them here. This one is a drip system and it's completely buried. Petey doesn't have access to it."

> "They're just under the rock and so you can find the emitters if you want to. That is a way you can get away from dogs that tend to be destructive with irrigation systems -- use a buried system and drip lends itself very well to that."

### Alternative: Spray Heads for Dog-Heavy Areas

In another project where the dogs were chewing up drip lines, John took a different approach:

> "We put in an irrigation system that the dogs can't damage. In another part of the garden they have drip system and they have a lot of problems with the dogs chewing it up and tearing it up. We just used a very simple system here with a lot of spray heads."

He prefers short pop-up spray heads that spray *under* the plant canopy:

> "Some people in shrub areas like to use real tall popups but I found no matter how tall the popup if the plant grows taller than the height of that popup you're going to have blockage. So I kind of came up with the concept that we try to spray under the plants and around and have water coming from all directions. So we've just used 4-in popups."

## Durable Plant Selections for Dog Yards

John's plant choices for Petey's yard emphasize toughness, resilience to being sat on or rolled over, and continuous color.

### The Selection Criteria

> "If your dog likes to destroy your plants or sit on them or roll around on them, you want to consider that when you make your plant choices. They like color, so almost all the plants bloom and they're tough. They're easy to grow. Pete could sit on them and they'd spring right back."

### Specific Plants Used in Petey's Yard

- **Bougainvillea:** Already performing well; they added more.
  > "They had a beautiful bougainvillea that really performs well for them. So, we added two more."

- **Plumbago:** Borrowed visual inspiration from the neighbor's plant.
  > "They have a mature plumbago kind of spilling over their fence from their neighbors and they really like it. So they added a couple of plumbago."

- **Hibiscus:** Surprisingly successful with good soil preparation.
  > "We moved to hibiscus which are doing incredibly well, better than I would have expected. We used a lot of our penetrate liquid biotiller on them and our blend and those are products that really help with transplanting."

- **Silvery Sunproof Liriope:** A low-growing, flowering ground-level plant.
  > "Some small plants like silvery sunproof liriope which is just a very low plant that blooms with an attractive flower in the middle."

- **Black Diamond Crepe Myrtle:** A small tree for a yard that already had big trees, providing a focal point with shade for the dog.
  > "They wanted something that doesn't get real big cuz their yard already has big trees. And so we used a small crepe myrtle. Only gets about 10 ft tall. It has red leaves which is unusual for crepe myrtle. It's called the black diamond series of crepe myrtles. And they're going to grow it as a multi-trunk very small tree."

  > "Petey will be able to sit under it and get a little bit of shade."

## Urine-Resistant Strategies

### On Natural Lawns

John is blunt about "Dog Rocks" -- a product sold to prevent lawn burn from urine:

> "Dog rocks are sold to stop lawn burn, and they're usually just rocks that you could find anywhere."

Pet urine stains on natural lawns are frequently misidentified:

> "With a regular lawn, you can get pet stains in the summer. Very, very common. People think they have fungus, but it's pet urine stains."

### On Artificial Turf

The simplest urine management is on artificial turf:

> "For dog urine, you rinse it off as frequently as you want. And then there is a method to actually once a year or so give it a better cleaning. You can keep it very clean without a lot of effort."

Use infill sand with antimicrobial coatings for hygiene:

> "This particular sand that we're using in this one has antimicrobial and antibacterial coatings on there to prevent mold and prevent mildew as well, particularly if there's going to be kids or pets playing around."

### On Rock and Hardscape

The 3/4" rock strategy also helps with urine -- liquid drains through rock rather than pooling on soil or killing grass. Combined with soil amendments that pass through the rock layer, the planting beds remain healthy even with pet use.

## Fence Line Solutions

John frequently addresses fence line plantings across his videos. For dog yards specifically, fence line plantings serve multiple purposes: screening neighbors, softening the look of the fence, and reducing the dog's visual stimulation from activity on the other side.

### Screening with Evergreens

> "We're almost always after Evergreen so that you never see the fence."

Recommended screening plants mentioned across projects include:

- **Privet** -- flexible and thick:
  > "You can see they've pruned it into a fence so there's a lot of flexibility with it for different spaces."

- **Podocarpus macrophyllus** -- tall background screen
- **Japanese Blueberry** -- good for blocking views
- **Boston Ivy** -- grows on the fence itself
- **Star Jasmine, Creeping Fig** -- vine options for fence coverage:
  > "Jasmine, Ivy, creeping fig -- all of those things if you have a fence make good green screens in addition to the fence, but usually you need some kind of support."

### Painting Fences to Recede

In small dog yards, John paints fences a dark color called "Dragon's Breath" to make them visually recede:

> "We painted them dragon's breath to make it a little more recessive since it's such a small yard."

## Creating Designated Dog Areas vs. Garden Areas

The Petey project is itself a masterclass in zoning a yard for dual use. The key strategies John employs:

### 1. The Turf Zone (Dog's Primary Area)

The artificial turf serves as the dog's main play and potty area -- easy to clean, impossible to dig, and durable under daily use.

> "That gets a lot of use. I like that if you're using something not just for looks, and in this case, the dog is using this lawn every day."

### 2. Rock-Mulched Planting Beds (Shared Zones)

The 3/4" rock beds allow plants to coexist with the dog. The dog is discouraged from digging but not excluded from the area. Tough, resilient plants are selected specifically because the dog will interact with them.

> "Pete could sit on them and they'd spring right back."

### 3. Hardscaped Human Areas (People Zones)

The new flagstone patio and steps create a clearly defined human-use courtyard:

> "Pete flies up those and then a big patio area, a courtyard area that they'll have some furniture on that we did in a flag stone that matches the color of the concrete and the trim of their house."

### 4. Irrigation Separation

In another dog-owner project, John specifically separates irrigation zones to protect vulnerable systems:

> "We put in an irrigation system that the dogs can't damage. In another part of the garden they have drip system and they have a lot of problems with the dogs chewing it up and tearing it up."

## Chemical Safety for Dog Households

John is a vocal critic of weed-and-feed products, particularly in homes with dogs:

> "Most weed and feeds have 24D and some other chemicals for the weed killer part. 24D is associated with cancer, kidney disease, reproductive problems. Studies have indicated that dog owners who use 24D products, their dogs are twice as likely to develop canine malignant lymphoma."

> "Weed-feed ingredients also have negative impacts on beneficial insects and honeybees. So with all these negative impacts of weed and feed and 24D, why do we want to use it all around our house?"

### Safer Alternatives

John recommends building soil health organically rather than relying on chemical weed-and-feed:

> "Focus on building the soil. And if you can, while you're doing that, ignore the weeds. When you do feed, feed with something that's good for your soil."

His own soil amendment products are emphasized as pet-safe:

> "It is very safe for pets and for kids."

> "100% organic, safe for people and pets."

If a chemical weed killer is truly necessary, John recommends spot treatment only, and suggests less toxic options like **Tenacity** (no link to cancer) or iron-based herbicides like **Captain Jack's Lawnweed Brew**.
