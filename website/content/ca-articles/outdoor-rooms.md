## Core Philosophy: "Gardens Are for People"

John Valentino returns again and again to one book and one idea as the foundation of everything he designs: Thomas Church's *Gardens Are for People*.

> "Probably the most famous home garden designer is Thomas Church. He wrote a fantastic book called Gardens Are for People. That saying, 'Gardens are for people' infers that gardens are to meet your needs, to make your life better. And so if we focus on that, making your life better in your own garden, then you're going to have a landscape that is pretty to you and that is functional for you and that meets your everyday needs and improves your life on an everyday basis."

> "Thomas Church's points are to create spaces that you can conduct everyday activities in and to do important things like shade your house and grow food."

Valentino ties Church's philosophy to two other luminaries he frequently quotes -- Louis Sullivan ("form follows function") and landscape architect Lawrence Halprin:

> "Form follows function... Frank Lloyd Wright had a whole career of form follows function and it also goes nicely with a lot of other landscape axioms that I really believe in and promote like Thomas Church wrote a book called Gardens Are for People -- we want people to be able to use gardens in a way that benefits their life."

> "One of my other favorites, Lawrence Halprin, who said the great challenge for the garden designer shouldn't be to make the garden natural but to make the garden so the people in it will feel natural."

> "Your challenge shouldn't be to make the garden natural. Your challenge should be to make the garden so the people in it will feel natural. That is speaking directly to how you use the garden."

The practical takeaway Valentino draws from all three thinkers is identical: **design the garden around human use first, aesthetics second**.

> "Let's make it more than just landscaping to look at from the street. Let's make it a garden we can walk through, a garden we can sit in and talk with neighbors, a garden that allows us to use it. You might have heard me say before, gardens are for people. And that's what you should keep in mind when you're designing your zeroscape garden."

## Moving the Landscape Away from the House (Anti-Foundation Planting)

One of Valentino's strongest and most frequently repeated convictions is that the old habit of lining plants up against the house -- so-called "foundation planting" -- is outdated, damaging, and ugly.

### The History

> "Many, many landscapes that you see have plants that are usually too big for their spot right up next to the house, and that is called foundation planting. It started because foundations used to be ugly. Look at your house. Is your house ugly? Do you need to cover it up? We don't need to cover the house."

> "We've evolved into houses that don't have ugly foundations but the foundation planting seems to have persisted and we're always trying to bring the plants out into the garden rather than have this row of plants up against the house."

### The Problem

> "We don't need to plant plants too close to the house that then invade on the windows, on the roof, make it hard to do common maintenance."

> "Planting big shrubs too close to your house can create some of the same problems. I like to keep big shrubs out away from the house where we don't have this example of lots of foundation planting right up next to the house. It makes the house difficult to maintain and also causes damage to the house."

### The Solution: Show the House, Create Spaces Around It

> "Usually quite the opposite. We want to show off the house. And the best way to show off the house, I think, is by creating useful spaces around it. Bring the landscape out away from the house and make a lot of interesting things going on with plantings and circulation and walkways. Let's do away with foundation planting. Let's focus on creative spaces in our garden and plants farther out away from our house."

> "This garden is a total remodel of a garden that was originally done in the 60s when the house was built. You'll recognize how it looked -- just a big lawn and then foundation planting, so plants up against the house, really no thought put to making it useful. Owner wanted to get away from that and do something that was more contemporary."

> "In this house it had foundation planting and other planting that just made it almost impossible to see the house. So the first thing we wanted to do here is to reveal the house and reveal the style of it and the architecture of it."

> "A useful important garden in my mind is, if you want to minimize maintenance, to do it with plants that you can allow to grow to their natural forms and you don't have to be clubbing them into submission in order for them not to swallow up your house."

---

## Insurance Concerns with Plants Near Structures

Valentino makes a practical financial argument against foundation planting:

> "We've run across many recently where insurance companies are getting tighter on branches touching the roof. Same thing with plants that grow all over the house -- they can ruin the integrity of the structure."

> "Heaving concrete, cracked walls, plumbing systems. Those are all things that are tremendously expensive to repair. That's where your thousands of dollars will go if you don't take care in selecting things that are appropriately sized for your lot."

> "So what we're trying to do is encourage you to select appropriate sized trees that won't cause root damage. And if you think they might cause root damage, you can use things like root barriers to make sure they don't."

His advice for small lots with big houses:

> "A lot of times mistakes are done with the size of the trees and here we used very small trees so that we're not going to have any problems down the road with cracking sidewalks and with trees that get too close to the house and spread out over the roof."

---

## Expanding the House into the Garden

Rather than keeping the landscape as something you look at from inside, Valentino designs to extend the living space outward.

> "Making the landscape as functional as possible and as contributory as possible to a better life by expanding the house out into the garden."

> "If you decide to build an arbor somewhere -- you like the idea of extending the garden out from the house almost like an outdoor room -- then consider the best opportunities for to do that where you have spaces in the house that are best expanded upon, like these double French doors. Obviously that's going to be a prime spot."

> "The courtyard off of the family room -- we used the same tile that's inside the house so that it looks like an extension of the house. And that's again attempting to expand the house out into the garden."

> "These big double French doors -- we can open both French doors. Kind of a spectacular view out of the family room into where would be our outdoor space and out to the pool... when the screen is up then these doors fully open out into the courtyard with the arbor over it which is right off of our family room."

The fence and hardscape design reinforces this:

> "The way the fence was designed is to make it look like an extension of the architecture of the house... it is an attempt to coordinate everything together so it looks like the fence is part of the house. It gives a coordination to the whole site."

---

## Creating Intimate Settings for Different Activities

### The Core Principle: Spaces with Purpose

> "The most important part of landscape design -- creating spaces. It can be something as simple as a bench and a seating area or it can include a small water feature of some type or a fire pit. There can be an element of it that you have a little extra something that helps you make that space special or it can just be under a shade tree."

> "Think about your landscape, your front and your backyards as a series of spaces or segments. These spaces can be very simple and inexpensive. So you don't end up with a real complicated, expensive final product, but you end up with something that you use every day and that's appealing and attractive, not just something to walk through to get to your front door."

### Matching Spaces to Activities

Valentino references *Gardens Are for People* directly when describing how each space should be tailored to its intended use:

> "Gardens Are for People encourages people to create great little intimate settings like this for different things like sleeping -- Eddie the lazy landscaper would love that. And it should be quiet, obviously. And if you're shelling the peas, it should be sheltered from wind. If you're drinking, it should be level. And it's these intimate spaces throughout your garden that I think can be a lot of fun."

> "Think about your own life and what you could use your garden for. Some people might want to have a place to talk to their neighbors or wait for a ride. There's all kinds of special uses you can get out of spaces in the garden that can make your life a lot more fun."

### Incorporating Mystery

Valentino argues against revealing everything at once:

> "Many are tempted to use all the strengths of their garden all in one view where you walk out your back door and you look at your yard and you see everything at once. And I submit to you that that's a mistake. We'd like to incorporate a little mystery into our gardens where you look at a certain vantage point and you can't see everything."

> "We have a garden that encourages you to walk through it and be surprised by special spaces and special views of special features. What we're trying to do is incorporate mystery into the garden design."

> "Even in this very small garden that we did with Japanese maples, it's very skillfully designed in a way where the clients walk out their back door and see kind of an informal hedge and a walkway. And once you get on that walkway, you turn the corner and there's more plantings and there's a bench and even though it's very tiny, you cannot see the whole garden by just looking out the back door and it's very intriguing and it gives mystery to the yard."

## Fire Pits, Pergolas, and Gathering Features

### Fire Features

> "Our first one is a little fire feature, which you can put in intimate spaces around the garden, or in this case, you can put it so you can see it from inside the house. We originally got the idea because we had a candle out here and then we thought, well, a little fire feature would be even a little neater and this is inexpensive. It's like having a miniature fire pit."

### Pergolas and Arbors

Eddie the Lazy Landscaper describes his own pergola and fire pit combination:

> "Well, I tell you, we recently put in a pergola with a roof so that we can be there year round and so this winter for the first time we're going to have a fire pit there now... And I can wave to my wife inside the house. But it's really a neat neat neat area of our yard that now we're utilizing year round."

Arbors serve as the structural definition of outdoor rooms:

> "The arbor defines the space of the outdoor kitchen and then there's furniture in it and it's directly adjacent to a pool."

> "This walkway very simply with straight lines goes to the front door and this is the only pedestrian entrance to the house from the street but it's a very simple circulation pattern and then it leads to this courtyard which is off of these large French doors and has an arbor."

### Water Features

> "The sound of water in a landscape is amazing. A great addition. And my next one ties into this -- it's small little water features. They come in many different shapes and sizes. And the neat thing about them is they look good, but they sound good. Rather than building a big waterfall, you can have a miniature little waterfall that reminds you of a big waterfall."

## Courtyards and Patios

### Front Courtyards

Valentino is a strong advocate for making front yards usable spaces rather than passive lawn:

> "In our work, we come up with front courtyards all the time that people can use beyond what they ever anticipated. So they can wait for a ride or talk to their neighbors. Get some use out of a front courtyard rather than having broad expansive lawn that you never use. You only look at and walk through to get to the front door."

> "Probably the most interesting feature of the front garden is the front courtyard which connects to this idea of making it as useful as possible... this wall was built out of concrete block with a pre-cast concrete cap. It was plastered and painted to match the house so that it looks like an extension of the house and it creates a nice entry and a nice place here with a fountain."

### Multiple Courtyards as Connected Spaces

In his own home design, Valentino shows how multiple courtyards serve different functions:

> "There are little courtyards off of the master bedroom that would be designed right now, a courtyard off of the guest bedroom... another courtyard behind the guest house. When you design a courtyard you probably have in mind where you're going to use things like pots and furniture."

> "As you walk through the garden there's a completely different type of outdoor space with the patio and some plantings and garden ornaments... then we have another type of outdoor seating area."

### Patio-Scale Design

> "The whole entrance to their house was few shallow steps that weren't easy to navigate for people. You can see we have very nice steps now. A landing. Pete flies up those and then a big patio area, a courtyard area that they'll have some furniture on that we did in a flag stone that matches the color of the concrete and the trim of their house."

---

## Seating Areas and Gathering Spaces

> "It has a nice seating area right before you get into the backyard, making it more interactive. I like this idea of interactive gardens. We can walk through it to the front door. We can experience interesting things along the way. And we can take a detour and go to the backyard and have a seat."

> "And then we come to our seating area which has some standard privet or ligustrum. Very nice shady spot to sit and contemplate the neighborhood or talk to Chip."

> "There's a little seating area and this has the circulation all the way around that connects to front parking."

> "To me, this is a great setting just to sit here and talk to you and look at those two fabulous cork oaks."

Valentino's emphasis is always that seating areas be connected to circulation and serve a genuine purpose -- not placed as decoration.

---

## Walkway and Path Design

### Function Before Creativity

> "The idea of setting up your circulation, so your walkways, your pathways based on use. I'm really fond of that idea that instead of racking your brain trying to be creative, let's rack our brains trying to be practical and functional and within that if we stick to bold lines, it can look extremely professional and be very useful at the same time."

### The College Campus Story

Valentino tells a favorite anecdote about letting use determine paths:

> "This idea I heard many years ago was addressing a college campus where when they made additions instead of putting in the circulation right away they allowed the students to establish the circulation where they could see the patterns that were being used because these were the best fastest ways to get where people needed to get and then build the circulation around that."

### Width Hierarchy

> "If it's a main circulation, you're going to consider either four or five foot walks. And if it's something more intimate, going to a private space, then you're probably going to narrow those down to three feet. And if it's really an intimate part that you would only go to occasionally, maybe you just have flagstone pavers, you know, taking you back to that spot. The size and the type of paving is a reflection of the amount of use."

### Line and Material Choices

> "In a natural garden, they're going to be more free form curve linear shapes and they're going to go by maybe groupings of rocks. And in a more formal or structured garden, you will have more straight lines. Just like when you pick plants, you have a feeling in mind. The same applies to circulation. The material and the shape of it evokes certain feelings. Concrete or brick, rock, flagstone paving. All of those are different feelings."

> "Whichever you choose, let's be direct. Let's be bold. Let's be simple about it. There's nothing wrong with straight lines."

### Inexpensive Path Construction

> "When you think of circulation and walkways, you might immediately think of concrete or asphalt or brick, but there's a much less expensive and environmentally friendly alternative that we do a lot of, and they are made out of a combination of decomposed granite and gravel."

> "These are pathways that we've done many, many times on many of our jobs and they make an excellent alternative to more expensive types of paving."

> "Circulation is one way to make your landscape look a lot more opulent. Easy to do and not expensive, especially if you use some of these ideas -- such as a gravel path with edging that is really good for the do-it-yourselfer."

### Circulation as Space-Maker

Good circulation patterns can make even small gardens feel larger:

> "The landscape architect that did it, Bob Borro, put in really a neat little circulation pattern and so we just stuck with that and just changed the plantings. But it's a really nice circulation pattern in a small garden. It gives it the sense of more space than is actually here."

### Utility Walkways

> "My thinking on little walkways is to make them as simple and as direct as possible."

## Eddie the Lazy Landscaper: Putting It All Together

Eddie is Valentino's recurring sidekick who embodies the principle that a well-designed garden should not require constant labor. His garden is used as a real-world demonstration of these space design concepts.

### Eddie's Pergola and Fire Pit

> "Well, I tell you, we recently put in a pergola with a roof so that we can be there year round and so this winter for the first time we're going to have a fire pit there now... And I can wave to my wife inside the house. But it's really a neat neat neat area of our yard that now we're utilizing year round."

### Eddie's Greenhouse as a Quiet Room

Eddie's wife built him a greenhouse that functions as a private retreat:

> "My wife was kind enough to have a greenhouse built for me... and when she's entertaining, it locks from the outside. But it's a quiet space for me and it's a quiet space for her, too."

### Eddie's Hammock

Eddie's garden is designed with lounging in mind:

> "But I don't want to leave this place. I mean, there's a hammock back there with my name on it."

### Right Plant, Right Place

> "I want to show you the garden of Eddie the lazy landscaper. Eddie's got a lot of good examples here of the right plant for the right place. It's really important to select your plants properly so you don't have to constantly be pruning them and you don't have to constantly be worried about them."

### Appropriate Foundation Planting at Eddie's

> "These roses just outside Eddie's window are a good example of appropriate foundation planting that doesn't get too big and doesn't need any special pruning."

### Colored Pots for Space Definition

> "Colored pots are another neat idea that we're stealing from Eddie the lazy landscaper. He is lazy, but he can be clever, too. And that addition of colored pots of all different shapes and sizes and colors is a really neat way to add color to your garden."

### The Lazy Landscaper Lesson

> "What we're trying to do is train our gardens -- like Eddie the lazy landscaper has -- to not have weeds. And you don't do that by constantly using weed killers."

> "You're creating a garden that Eddie the lazy landscaper would thrive in because it will need very little outside help. It's a self-sustaining ecosystem if you do it."

## Design Process: From Bubble Diagrams to Real Spaces

Valentino teaches a step-by-step approach to designing outdoor rooms:

1. **Site analysis** -- understand sun, drainage, views, existing features
2. **Program** -- list every use you want the garden to serve
3. **Bubble diagrams** -- rough spatial relationships without committing to forms
4. **Circulation and form** -- translate bubbles into actual walkway shapes, patio dimensions, courtyard placement

> "Bubble diagrams include circulations but instead of drawing the shape of the walks you'll draw a bubble and show, you know, here's how I get from this space to this space."

> "Form follows function tells you that the first consideration should be the function of it, how you're going to use it."

> "The next step which we'll talk about today is to go from the bubble diagrams to real forms and real circulation and real spaces."

---

## Patio-Scale Trees for Outdoor Rooms

> "I like to talk a lot about patio scale trees. And patio scale trees -- like you have at your house next to your pool -- make it so that you can do lots of interesting things around those."

> "For small lots, we like to plant small trees, what we call patio scale trees, so that we can do other types of planting and create gardens that aren't one-dimensional."

> "There's a lot of small gardens these days that don't have room for big trees so what you can do is you can take a plant that's really not very big and turn it into a small patio tree."

---

## Lighting as Space Definition

> "Garden lighting can make your landscape look absolutely dramatic. And what we like to do is focus on lighting up two areas. One is wherever possible we want to light up trees with interesting branching and proper pruning. We like to have the whole thing be ambient lit by the lighting of the trees. The second to focus on is safety and utility which requires that you light up the paths and the walkways."

> "If we have nice path lights that guide the way, then we've got a really important walkway and circulation that's useful and attractive at the same time."

---

## Vines and Screens for Room-Making

> "Strategically placed vines are a great addition to the garden, which can add color in the form of bloom, interest in the pattern it makes on a wall, and privacy. The vine can either screen noise or screen views that are undesirable. And in that way, vines can be another part of creating these separate spaces inexpensively."

---

## Key Principles Summary

| Principle | Valentino's Approach |
|---|---|
| **Foundation planting** | Eliminate it. Reveal the house. Move plants out into the garden. |
| **Spaces** | Think of your yard as a series of separate rooms, each with a purpose. |
| **Circulation** | Design walkways based on use, not decoration. Bold, simple lines. |
| **Intimacy** | Vary the size and character of spaces -- some for gathering, some for solitude. |
| **Mystery** | Never reveal everything at once. Use hedges, grade changes, and turns to surprise. |
| **Extending the house** | Use matching materials, arbors, and French doors to blur indoor/outdoor boundaries. |
| **Insurance and maintenance** | Keep plants appropriately sized. Avoid branches on roofs. Drainage away from the house. |
| **Low maintenance** | Select the right plant for the right place. Let plants grow to natural form. |
| **Budget** | Gravel paths, colored pots, small water features, and vines deliver impact cheaply. |
