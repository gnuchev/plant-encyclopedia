# Garden Gimmicks & Myths to Avoid

**Source:** YouTube transcripts of John Valentino / John and Bob's (Fresno, CA -- USDA Zone 9), landscape professional with 47+ years of experience. Approximately 120 videos on California landscaping.

> "Stop right there. Before you spend another penny on your garden, I need you to watch this video. There is a lot of stuff out there that's draining your wallet and not helping your landscape look any better at all. So, today I will share with you the biggest garden gimmicks and landscape letdowns. You'd be surprised how many of these are popular."

## 1. Vitamin B1 for Transplant Shock

**The Myth:** Adding vitamin B1 to transplanted plants reduces transplant shock and encourages new root formation. Products are widely sold at garden centers specifically marketing this claim.

**Why People Believe It:** A study in the 1930s appeared to confirm the benefit, and the products have been continuously marketed ever since.

**Why It Is Wrong:** The original researcher himself recanted. As John explains:

> "The original study was done way back in the 1930s. His study proved that vitamin B1 helped with transplant shock and with allowing plants or encouraging plants to form new roots. He actually recanted that in 1942, saying he was wrong. And since then, additional studies at University of California and Washington State University have proven that there's no benefit to vitamin B1."

Despite being debunked for over 80 years:

> "Starting in the 1930s till today, we still have products marketing the benefits of vitamin B1, promoting it to do exactly what it doesn't do. So, you might as well not buy it and use it for that purpose."

**What to Do Instead:** Focus on healthy soil and proper watering:

> "What does help with transplant shock and forming new roots is healthy soil and also proper watering. Proper watering is probably the most important part of transplanting plants. In the first day or two, you probably need to make sure they're a little bit overwatered. Now, you need to quickly transition into proper watering, and you don't want a saturated soil."

## 2. Tree Wound Sealant / Pruning Paint / Tar

**The Myth:** After pruning, you should seal the cut with special paint, black pitch, or tar to protect the tree and help it heal.

**Why People Believe It:** It sounds logical -- covering a wound to protect it, similar to how we bandage human wounds. Products are readily available at hardware stores and garden centers.

**Why It Is Wrong:** The sealant actually slows recovery and creates conditions for pests and disease:

> "It's marketed as a way to help your trees heal after pruning, but in reality, it slows recovery and causes them to be more likely to be diseased. It's kind of similar, eerily similar to the B1 story. This has been known for a long time and yet it persists that you can go into hardware stores and garden centers and buy special paint or black pitch or tar. And the idea is I want to protect those cuts and that's just completely wrong and completely unproductive and completely problematic."

The products create environments that attract the very problems you are trying to prevent:

> "By using those products, they tend to develop cracks in them, which are spaces for insects to nest. And so we end up with these environments that actually encourage pests and disease. And that's the opposite of what we want to be doing when we're pruning."

**What to Do Instead:** Make clean, smooth cuts in the right places and let them heal naturally:

> "What we want to do is make really nice smooth cuts in exactly the right places. And those smooth cuts exposed to air and everyday weather peel over the best without any paint."

Use good pruning tools, and when dealing with heavy branches, make a preliminary cut first to remove the weight before making the final cut at the branch collar.

> "If you've ever sealed a pruning cut with black tar, don't worry, Chip and I don't judge."

## 3. Plastic Edging

**The Myth:** Plastic edging is a cost-effective way to define borders between lawn, beds, and hardscape in your landscape.

**Why People Believe It:** It is cheap and appears to do the job when first installed.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Temperature swings destroy it, especially in climates like Fresno's:

> "Plastic edging. At first blush, and on paper, it's great. It's cheap, and it seems to do the job, but it does many things poorly. Hot weather makes it contract and expand in ways that don't allow it to stay in place. It doesn't like cold weather either. Warming and cooling in general makes the plastic edging not hold its shape and its form and its grade properly."

It cannot survive normal landscape maintenance:

> "It's not durable in terms of being hit. Edging you'll have to assume is going to get hit with a blade or a weed eater or something because it's edging. So you add it all up and you've got a cheap material that performs cheaply and not effectively."

In another video on xeriscaping, John reiterates:

> "Don't use cheap plastic edging. It doesn't hold its shape well. Even though it's cheaper, it's not worth it in the long run. It produces an inferior look and an inferior product."

**What to Do Instead:** Invest in durable, permanent metal edging:

> "You can use some more durable form of permanent edging. One that we use a lot of is a brand called Permaedge. And they make different types of metal edging that are easy to install. You might save money up front, but in the end, you'll need to replace it if you want it to look good and you want it to function properly."

## 4. Spiked Aeration Shoes

**The Myth:** Strap-on spiked shoes let you aerate your lawn by simply walking around on it -- a cheap and easy alternative to core aeration.

**Why People Believe It:** They are sold as a convenient, inexpensive gadget that turns a chore into a stroll.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Spike shoes do not perform actual core aeration. They just poke holes rather than removing soil plugs, and do not effectively relieve compaction:

> "Spiked aeration shoes. Better to rent a real core aeration machine which does it properly."

John groups these among gadgets that promise to change your life but "just collect spider webs in your shed."

**What to Do Instead:** If your lawn is truly compacted, rent a proper core aeration machine. Better yet, build healthy soil that aerates itself:

> "Given proper inputs in your lawn, building this lively soil full of beneficial microbiology, we could eliminate both core aeration and dethatching. Healthy soil aerates itself through microbiology and all of the result of microbiology such as earthworms."

---

## 5. Moisture Meters

**The Myth:** Inexpensive moisture meters give you reliable readings of your soil moisture so you know when to water.

**Why People Believe It:** They are widely available, cheap, and seem scientific.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "Moisture meters, which are very popular, are often inaccurate and they break quickly."

**What to Do Instead:** Learn to read your plants and soil. Develop proper watering schedules based on plant needs, soil type, and weather. John advocates understanding your soil's tilth and building healthy soil that manages moisture effectively through good microbiology and organic matter.

---

## 6. Dog Rocks

**The Myth:** Placing special rocks in your dog's water bowl will neutralize the nitrogen in their urine and prevent lawn burn spots.

**Why People Believe It:** They are marketed specifically for this purpose and appeal to dog owners desperate to save their lawns.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "Dog rocks are sold to stop lawn burn, and they're usually just rocks that you could find anywhere."

**What to Do Instead:** Water the area immediately after your dog urinates to dilute the nitrogen concentration, or designate a specific area of the yard for the dog. Build robust, healthy lawn soil that recovers faster.

---

## 7. "As Seen on TV" Pruners

**The Myth:** Television-marketed pruners with flashy demonstrations will perform as well as professional tools.

**Why People Believe It:** Persuasive marketing and impressive on-screen demonstrations.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "As seen on TV, pruners, which are usually low quality and break easily."

**What to Do Instead:** Invest in quality hand shears and loppers from reputable brands:

> "You'll need both hand shears of good quality and then you need more like loppers. ... In all cases, invest in good quality tools and they'll last you a long time and they'll allow you to do a really good job."

---

## 8. Magnetic Water Softeners

**The Myth:** Magnetic devices attached to your irrigation pipes will soften hard water and improve plant health.

**Why People Believe It:** They are sold as a chemical-free, install-and-forget solution to hard water problems common in Central California.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "Magnetic water softeners are sold for irrigation systems and usually they're not effective."

**What to Do Instead:** If hard water is a concern, consult with an irrigation professional about legitimate water treatment options. Focus on building healthy soil biology that can better process available minerals.

---

## 9. Adding Iron to Lawns

**The Myth:** If your lawn or plants are yellowing, you need to add iron supplements to the soil.

**Why People Believe It:** Iron chlorosis (yellowing leaves) does relate to iron, so adding more seems logical. Iron-supplement products are widely available.

**Why It Is Wrong:** The problem is almost never a lack of iron in the soil -- it is that plants cannot uptake the iron that is already there:

> "Adding iron might sound like you're giving your lawn a mineral boost, but it's often a waste of money because you're addressing the wrong problem. Most soil already has a lot of minerals in it and usually a lot of iron. What you need to focus on is how do you get the plant to uptake iron?"

John elaborates on the iron chlorosis mechanism in another video:

> "Even when you have iron chlorosis, usually, not 100% of the time, but usually your soil has plenty of iron. For one reason or another, your plants can't uptake the iron even though it's in the soil. Usually, you've already tried putting more iron in the soil and you still have iron chlorosis."

**What to Do Instead:** Build soil biology so that microbes can make the existing iron available to plants:

> "Rather than adding iron, we really want to add beneficial microbiology. The way it works is bacteria and fungi eat organic matter. When they eat, they break nutrients into tiny usable pieces. Then protozoa and nematodes eat the bacteria and the fungi. And when they poop, they release nutrients in exactly the form that plants can absorb."

> "Soil microbes make nutrients available to plants by breaking down organic matter through mineralization."

---

## 10. Routine Aeration & Dethatching (When Not Needed)

**The Myth:** Every lawn needs to be aerated and dethatched annually as part of standard maintenance.

**Why People Believe It:** It has been repeated as lawn-care gospel for decades, promoted heavily on YouTube and at equipment rental shops.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Most people do not have the conditions that actually require these services:

> "Aeration would be effective if you have really hard compacted turf and you want to try to soften it. ... Dethatching is done when you have a buildup of thatch. Thatch builds up when you use mostly chemical fertilizer and you don't have a lot of life in your soil."

> "A lot of people don't have a thatch buildup and they just know, oh every year I should dethatch. Well, that's just a waste of money."

**What to Do Instead:** Build living soil that handles both problems naturally:

> "Healthy soil aerates itself through microbiology and all of the result of microbiology such as earthworms. And all of that activity in the soil eats the thatch."

---

## 11. Landscape Fabric / Weed Barrier Around Plants

**The Myth:** Landscape fabric (weed cloth) placed under mulch and around plants will permanently suppress weeds while allowing water and air through.

**Why People Believe It:** It works as advertised for the first month or two.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Over time, the fabric clogs with silt, roots, and decomposing matter, then actively harms plants:

> "Over time, the problem with landscape fabric, particularly if you put it right up against plants, is it inhibits the ability of the plant to get water. That fabric gets a little bit plugged either with soil or decomposing mulch or a whole variety of things and over time that fabric becomes less and less able to exchange air and water."

> "As you as these plants start to grow, you get a lot of root growth and you get damage to the fabric that way where it starts becoming kind of a mess mixed in with roots. And so it really doesn't work well. My experience is it does not work well at all in planted areas. I would avoid it completely."

It also blocks the ability to feed the soil from the surface:

> "Plants will do much better without landscape fabric. The process of feeding soil is much easier to accomplish without landscape fabric because usually our products and most products get to go into the soil profile from the top. That's difficult to do if you have landscape fabric that tends to get clogged with roots or sediment."

**What to Do Instead:** Use 2-3 inches of quality organic mulch and re-apply annually:

> "I'd like you to consider using mulch instead of landscape fabric. If you continue to remulch, you will go a long ways toward producing really active, microbiologically healthy soil."

Landscape fabric is acceptable only in areas without plants, such as under rock mulch on pathways or other hardscape areas.

## 12. Dyed / Colored Mulch

**The Myth:** Dyed mulch (red, black, or other colors) is just as good as natural mulch and looks more attractive.

**Why People Believe It:** It is brightly colored and widely sold at big-box stores.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "One of the biggest mistakes in my opinion is that ugly, stupid, toxic dyed mulch that you see people use, sometimes reddish, sometimes black, where they take a plain brown wood product that they think doesn't have enough coloring and they dye it. It's not a good idea. It's not good for your plants. It's not good for your soil."

**What to Do Instead:** Use natural, undyed wood mulch products such as shredded cedar, arbor mulch, or gorilla hair (shredded redwood bark). Apply 2-3 inches and keep it a few inches away from trunks and stems.

---

## 13. "Mulch Steals Nitrogen from Plants"

**The Myth:** Wood mulch on the soil surface robs nitrogen from your plants, starving them of nutrients.

**Why People Believe It:** There is a tiny kernel of truth -- decomposing wood does use some nitrogen at the surface. This has been repeated neighbor-to-neighbor for generations.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "This current garden myth that I'd like to dispel today is that when you use mulch, it takes away from the nutrients for your plants. Although there is a little bit of truth to it, which is why I think it hangs around. This organic matter that we use as top dressing mulch starts to break down, it does need and use some nitrogen and microbes as part of the process."

> "But the truth is that it's only using nitrogen on the very surface, and your plants have roots that are way deeper than the surface. It doesn't impact the nutrients in the soil where your roots are."

The one scenario where it could be a problem:

> "Where it could be a concern is if you took say a coarse top dress mulch and you tilled it in. Now you have all of this wood with some bulk to it and some substance to it kind of tilled in and that does need nitrogen to decompose."

**What to Do Instead:** Use mulch as a top dressing -- do not till it into the soil. Replenish nitrogen through healthy gardening practices (compost, compost tea, organic amendments).

---

## 14. Amending the Planting Hole with Different Soil (The "Bathtub Effect")

**The Myth:** When planting a tree, you should fill the hole with rich amended soil or potting mix to give the tree a better start.

**Why People Believe It:** It seems logical that better soil would help a new tree establish.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Creating a pocket of different-textured soil causes the "bathtub effect" -- roots refuse to grow out into the native soil, and water cannot properly drain:

> "All soil scientists and arborists agree that it isn't beneficial to use a lot of bulk amendment in the back fill because we want trees to root out into their native soil. We usually recommend using the native soil so we don't have a difference in texture. So you're not creating what is sometimes called the bathtub effect where you've got a hole that is a certain texture and a certain quality of soil and then you create an interface where that meets up with the native soil and the plants won't root out into that."

In another video:

> "Put brand new beautiful soil in there that's completely different than the native soil -- I don't recommend that. What that does is create what some people call like the bathtub effect where that just sits there and roots won't go into it, water won't go out of it."

**What to Do Instead:** Backfill with native soil. Dig the hole wide (2 to 2.5 times the root ball width). Then improve the soil biologically from the surface with compost, compost tea, or concentrated microbial products.

---

## 15. Gravel in the Bottom of Pots for "Drainage"

**The Myth:** Placing a layer of gravel or rocks at the bottom of a pot improves drainage.

**Why People Believe It:** Gravel drains well on its own, so a layer of it at the bottom seems like it would help water exit the pot faster.

**Why It Is Wrong:** The science of soil interfaces means it does the exact opposite:

> "What we want to avoid in every situation in gardening is interfaces. And that is where you have material of a certain texture -- whether it's soil or gravel or whatever -- interfacing with a completely different texture. And in this case, if we put a bunch of gravel in the bottom of the pot and then we fill the rest up with a really good quality potting soil, that potting soil will not drain into and through the gravel until the top layer, which is a completely different texture, becomes saturated."

> "It needs to become saturated first. And we don't want saturation. We want drainage. So, you are impeding drainage when you put a layer of gravel like this."

**What to Do Instead:** Use a quality potting soil that drains well on its own, and ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes. Do not create texture interfaces inside the container.

---

## 16. Smaller Irrigation Pipe = More Pressure

**The Myth:** Reducing the pipe size at the end of an irrigation line increases water pressure at the sprinkler heads.

**Why People Believe It:** It is an intuitive (but wrong) assumption about fluid dynamics, and even many professionals believe it.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "Almost all professionals, if they don't really understand irrigation design, they say, 'Oh, we want to make it smaller at the end to increase the pressure. So, we'll go down to a half inch or 3/4 pipe. We get more pressure.' That is 100% wrong. You do increase velocity, but you decrease pressure."

> "The only reason you use smaller pipe is not to increase pressure. It's to save money because the smaller pipe is a lot less expensive than a big pipe."

**What to Do Instead:** Use proper pipe sizing based on friction-loss calculations:

> "What irrigation designers that know what they're doing, what they do is they calculate what's the smallest pipe I can put throughout the system that will carry the amount of water that needs to be carried that will have minimal pressure loss due to friction."

John's practical rule: never use half-inch pipe -- always use at least 3/4-inch pipe for sprinkler runs to maintain adequate pressure.

---

## 17. Replacing Potting Soil Every Year

**The Myth:** Container plants require fresh potting soil every year because the old soil becomes depleted and useless.

**Why People Believe It:** Garden centers promote the idea, and it is true that container soil does leach nutrients over time.

**Why It Is Wrong:**

> "Don't change your potting soil every year. And this is what I might call a garden myth. It's one that many garden centers promote because it's thought that if you are growing things in pots that mine the soil, the soil leeches very dramatically. But I like to use ways of enriching that soil so that you don't need to."

> "It's a lot of expense and a lot of work to be changing potting soil all the time in containers."

**What to Do Instead:** Rejuvenate existing potting soil with biological amendments:

> "We infuse that soil with life on an annual and maybe even semi-annual basis. ... By having this light soil in pots that is constantly rejuvenated with not only nutrients but beneficial bacteria, good fungi, protozoa and all kinds of life in the soil. Then we are able to have soil that doesn't need to be replaced. It might need to be topped off now and then because you will get some settling."

---

## 18. Heading-Back Cuts on Trees (Topping)

**The Myth:** You can control the size of a tree by cutting branches in half (heading back), and this is normal pruning.

**Why People Believe It:** It seems like the fastest way to reduce tree size, and many untrained "tree trimmers" do it routinely.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Heading back creates weakly attached regrowth that becomes dangerous, destroys the tree's natural beauty, and causes long-term damage:

> "Improper pruning where we're doing heading back cuts is terrible for trees and violates this rule of trying to get them as big as possible and as properly shaped as possible so they can maximize their value."

> "If you have a big oak, beautiful oak tree, and you head it back, you really cause problems for the tree down the road because under the cuts sprouts all kinds of new growth. And that new growth, if it's in the middle of a big branch, is very weakly attached. And so now it becomes a dangerous tree."

> "If you're doing heading back cuts, you're creating trees that all look alike. They just look like a big blob on top of a trunk. They won't display their natural form and they'll be weak. We're doing a disservice to the trees and a disservice to us."

**What to Do Instead:** Use thinning cuts -- remove entire branches back to their point of origin:

> "The proper way to prune most of these trees is with thinning cuts, not with heading back cuts. And with thinning cuts, you allow the tree to display its beauty."

---

## 19. Treating Pests with Chemicals Instead of Building Soil

**The Myth:** When pests like root-knot nematodes appear, the solution is to apply chemical pesticides.

**Why People Believe It:** It is the most obvious, immediate-seeming response to a pest problem.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Chemical treatments destroy all soil life, including the beneficial organisms, leaving the soil lifeless and even more vulnerable:

> "When people treat for root-knot nematodes with chemicals, you start this process of damaging life in your soil and it can become severely damaged. In fact, after using typical products to kill root-knot nematodes, the soil is pretty much lifeless and not a good place to garden."

> "Those poison products that are frequently used don't even cure the problem. Sometimes the problem comes right back."

**What to Do Instead:** Build beneficial soil life that naturally suppresses pests:

> "The best way to eradicate pests and disease and not waste thousands of dollars is to focus on beneficial complex soil life. ... The best way is to build soil life where we have beneficial nematodes."

---

## 20. Using Perforated Pipe for Drainage Near Plants

**The Myth:** Perforated drainage pipe is better than solid pipe because water seeps into the soil as it travels.

**Why People Believe It:** The concept of distributing water along the pipe run sounds efficient.

**Why It Is Wrong:** Plant roots invade through the perforations and clog the pipe:

> "Some people use pipe with holes in it with the idea that the water will seep into the soil as it goes. The problem with that is if you have plants nearby, the roots go into those holes and end up plugging up the drainage pipes."

**What to Do Instead:** Use solid pipe for drainage near planted areas. Direct the water to an appropriate discharge point away from your house foundation.
