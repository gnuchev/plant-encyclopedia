## 1. The Waterfall Effect (Cascading Heights)

The single most-referenced design concept on the channel. Every bed should read like a waterfall flowing from the tallest element at the rear down to the lowest ground cover at the front edge.

**Core idea:** "Just think of it as a waterfall. Just start from the top and you just kind of want to see your defined layers kind of all the way down to the ground cover. And that's what gives you that lush garden feel."

**How to execute:**
- Identify your tallest "roof line" trees (coconut palms, traveler's palms) and place them at the rear.
- Step down through intermediate palms (Triangle Fan Palm, Foxtail Palm) in front of those.
- Continue stepping down through Pygmy Date Palms, accent shrubs, and bush-height plantings (Crotons, Arboricola).
- Finish at the front edge with ground covers (Blue My Mind, Gold Mound, Foxtail Ferns).

**Example sequence from one bed:** Clusia wall (rear) --> Brazilian Red Cloaks (8 ft) --> Java White Copper Leaf --> dwarf Pentas --> Blue My Mind (front edge).

"You take those levels and those layers from your smallest plant of your ground cover all the way to your biggest tree. And that's that waterfall effect. That's what when it comes together and you're like, I kind of don't know why I like that landscaping over maybe that landscaping, but it just works."

**Gallon-size tip for phased waterfall:** "Start with your big material first, then come in with your layered material... your 30-gallon plants. Everything in your backdrop would be your big stuff. And then you can come in with your next tier -- 15 gallon and then below seven gallon, three gallon, one gallon. And that's a great way to make sure you're working in layers."

## 2. Dark/Light Sandwiching

Alternate dark-leafed and bright-leafed plants through every bed to create visual pop and perceived depth. The designer calls this "sandwiching."

**The rule:** "You want to go dark, light, dark. Replicate that. You'll notice that I do that through all of my landscapes."

**Direct quote on execution:** "So you kind of see how we go from light, dark, light, dark, and then it just kind of a rinse and repeat."

**Key sub-principles:**
- "Anytime you put a green screen next to anything... it brings out the color of everything else."
- Green foliage is considered "a supporting cast member in the group... the thing that really kind of brings it all together. Don't be afraid to throw a little bit of green in that group."
- Bright plants (Song of India, Sanchezia, Java White Copper Leaf) should be "sandwiched" into dark spots: "Sanchezia is a great kind of bright tone in a dark spot. So sandwich those things in between your dark colors."
- "Sandwich your stars of the show with something kind of more moderate, more clean-line but one solid color, and then these will show off in time way, way more."

**Texture contrast reinforces color contrast:** "Where there's not a sharp [color] contrast, there's a sharp leaf contrast. A sharp type of where this is a fuzzy leaf or this is an upright leaf where this is a rounded or shiny leaf. If you can do that, that'll take you from your basic landscape to more of your complexity."

## 3. Triangular / Staggered Formations (Never Flat Rows)

One of the most frequently repeated rules: never plant in straight rows; always stagger plants in triangular or zigzag formations.

**The rule:** "I'm a zigzagger kind of landscaper."

**For groupings of three:** "Three in a triangle formation. Two to the back, one pulled forward. Here we have two to the front, one pulled back. I love that zigzag pattern because my whole goal is to make six plants look like one plant."

**For groupings of four or more:** "If you do like a grouping of four or six or 10, [do] a zigzag pattern. Or if you have to do it in a small area, do a grouping of three in a triangular pattern because that becomes a cluster grouping, it grows so well together."

**The anti-row principle:** "You kind of want to get away from that row planting because it's so easy for things to turn into a hedge. So either stagger back and forth to let them chunk out together or create a triangular formation where that point goes to these two and then it rounds out and becomes like a just this nice big pop of colorful cluster."

**Staggering applies at every scale:**
- Palm trees: "Anytime that I'm working with a tall grouping of palm trees, I really want to make sure to stagger them. Look, we have like a triangular formation of these royals here."
- Ground cover: "I never put them in a straight pattern... stagger a zigzag pattern, takes you from a narrow swath to a nice wide swath."
- Even between tiers: "The trees are staggered forward and backwards, forward and backwards to make the curve."

## 4. Curve, Corner, and Loop Techniques for Bed Shaping

**Curved beds:** Beds should flow with gentle curves, not hard geometric lines. "This loop comes out to about 10 to 10 and a half feet wide right here at the biggest portion and then it swoops in and gradually goes into the six and five foot range as it curves in and then pops back out just to kind of give us a little bit of flow."

**Corner softening:** Every hard architectural corner (screen roof, patio, pool wall, house corner) should be softened with plantings that cascade or weep over the edge. "When you have a rectangular area like this, the corners you're going to find usually a little bit of room and that's the area that you want to make sure whatever you put landscape-wise really softens the corner."

**Corner planting strategy:** Place chunky, weeping plants (Pygmy Date Palms) on corners that fold over walls, then use vertical, flat-profile trees (Traveler's Palm, Triangle Fan Palm, King Alexander) along the straight runs. "It's really going to be like wild and crazy and chunky on the corners and then very vertical everywhere else."

**Loop beds:** Island beds in the front yard should loop out from the house and curve back. Beds can be lifted and re-curved over time using flexible edging.

**Entrance staggering:** At entry points, offset the two flanking beds rather than making them perfectly symmetrical: "Instead of it being right across from each other at your entrance way, stagger it forward. One pushed back, one pulled forward."

## 5. Boulder Placement Rules

Boulders are a recurring design element used for texture change, eye-resting points, and zero-maintenance interest.

**Size:** "Basketball-sized boulders, inset them flat side on the ground." Also "a tad bit bigger than a football size" or "handheld boulders." These are not massive landscape boulders -- in Florida terms, they are small to moderate.

**Inset rule:** "I inset the edges of my boulders into the ground because I like that look. It doesn't look like something set on top of anything. I like that everything to be inset and really have a place in the gardens."

**What to plant around boulders:** "Almost every time I do a unique boulder in a landscape, I'll put some foxtail ferns or some agave or some Bromeliads, whatever the budget allows, to kind of frame that boulder to kind of give it a little bit of a highlight." In a triangular formation of three foxtail ferns around a boulder is a go-to combination.

**Purpose:** "They add a change of texture... your landscape's going to grow around them. All you do is trim around the boulders so that way it's always seen in the garden and it just becomes a place to rest your eye."

**Coquina boulders** are the preferred type: "I love the coquina boulders. I love what they offer. Some of them have the holes in them where you can pop a Bromeliad or an interesting succulent into it."

**Boulders as element changes:** "Just like I would change a contrast of a frond to a leaf or to a different type of soft foliage to more dynamic foliage, a boulder does the same kind of look but offers no care."

## 6. Gallon-Size Manipulation for Instant Layering

Manipulating the container size at purchase is a primary tool for creating instant layers and cascading height from day one.

**The principle:** "You can do this by changing and manipulating the gallon size."

**Budget-phased approach:** Start with the largest material (30-gallon backdrop trees), then fill in with 15-gallon, then 7-gallon, then 3-gallon, then 1-gallon ground covers. "If you can start with your big material first, then come in with your layered material."

**Waterfall sizing example:** "Go ahead and put your coconut palm there. Then come in with your Triangle Palm -- that's 25 gallon, that's going to be about half the size. Then come in with your Pygmy Date Palm, that's going to be about half the size of that. And then tear down. That way when you're looking at it, you have this great waterfall effect all the way to the space."

**Spacing by gallon size:**
- 1-gallon: 1 to 2 feet on center
- 3-gallon: solid 2 feet on center
- 7-gallon: 2 to 3 feet on center (depending on plant)
- 15-gallon and up: varies by species

**Preferred starting sizes by role:**
- Privacy hedge (Clusia): 10-gallon minimum, ideally 15-gallon ("They came in about 4 feet tall, so they're really starting off to a great start")
- Centerpiece palms: 25-gallon ("My favorite size to get")
- Accent shrubs (Sloppy Painter Crotons): "Get them in seven or 15 gallon size... seven gallon, they're chunkier."
- Ground covers: 1 to 3 gallon

## 7. The Star and Supporting Cast Principle

Every bed grouping should have a clear hierarchy: one "star" or centerpiece feature surrounded by a "supporting cast" that frames and showcases it.

**The concept:** "They're almost like the supporting cast in a great movie. You've got the movie, you've got the features, you've got the stars. Now it's time to bring in the compliments. Now it's time to bring in the lipstick and mascara, the things that are really going to showcase those things."

**The False Agave example:** "The False Agave is meant to be the star of the show. So, all of these to the bottom are supposed to crown around it. So the little Ruby Reds, the Gold Mound, the little touch of the fire orange Lantana."

**Green as supporting cast:** "It's a supporting cast member in the group... the thing that really kind of brings it all together."

**How to identify your star:** The star should be something vertical, structural, and eye-catching -- agaves, specialty palms, water features, sculptural accent trees. "Anything vertical -- agave, dune palms, birds of paradise, anything along those lines. That's what draws your eye."

**Framing the centerpiece:** "Every time you have an accent feature, make sure to just dial it in with a ground cover or something to curve around the base of it just to kind of give it a little bit of a support system."

## 8. Swath / Drift Planting for Professional Rhythm

Plant in sweeping groups (drifts or swaths) of a single variety rather than mixing individual specimens. This creates rhythm, flow, and a professional look.

**The core rule:** "I plant in drifts. Even as a tropical landscaper, I plant in drifts."

**How it works:** "I'll do a drift of Sanchezia and then it stops and breaks and then a drift of Burle Marx and then a drift of Crotons."

**Minimum group size:** "I usually put them in groupings more than three." Groupings of four, six, or ten are preferred. "If you have to do it in a small area, do a grouping of three."

**The break between drifts:** "Just do one drift then stop, like a break, and then do another drift. And if you can pay attention to the height growth on those things and make sure one drift is higher than the other drift."

**Avoid singles and pairs:** "Planting in one or twos... then you have this concoction of a bunch of different plants kind of just trying to fight each other off in the gardens." Instead: "Plant in swaths -- it gives you that more of a professional look."

**Color partners across drifts:** "Almost every plant in here has a color partner. So that way when you look at the whole bed, it doesn't feel like you have all the same plants in one bed, but you have the same plant colorations."

**Height variation between drifts:** "Not only does the variety of plants change, but the height and the levels change... Not only does it change with color, lights and darknesses, or texture -- big leaf, little leaf -- but it also does that with heights."

---

## 9. Creating "Movement" in a Bed

Movement refers to both visual flow (eye travel through a bed) and literal movement of foliage in the breeze.

**Visual movement:** Create a "sequence of movement" by having the bed rise and fall through different heights: "It's going to go boom, boom, back down to the foxtail ferns, up to the variegated Arboricola, up to the tallest version of these Pinocchio Crotons, and then down to the Song of India, and then all the way down to the Liriope at the end. So when this bed comes together, it's going to be just like a sequence of movement."

**Literal movement (kinetic interest):** Use plants with flowing, weeping, or lacy foliage to catch the breeze. Pygmy Date Palms have "a lot of movement" from their weeping fronds. Fish Tail Palms have a "flowy kind of movement... hear those fronds and that movement." Triangle Fan Palms provide movement plus "the shadow effect" in the garden.

**Movement from dark/light alternation:** The eye is "drawn" through the bed by alternating highlights and dark zones. "You want to have enough dark and light, dark and light, dark and light, but end it in that darker area with a light pattern or a light bloom because... [it] makes you want to say, 'Oh, what's happening over there?'"

## 10. Bed Depth and Width Guidelines

**Ideal deep bed:** 8 feet deep provides room for four full layers (ground cover, accent shrubs, trees, privacy hedge). "This bed is 8 feet deep, which is a good amount of space."

**Four-layer allocation in 8 feet:**
1. Ground cover (1 ft from front edge to center of plant)
2. Accent shrubs/Crotons (2 ft from front edge)
3. Feature trees like Foxtail Palms (4 ft from front edge)
4. Privacy hedge/Clusia (6 ft from front edge, with 2 ft maintenance path behind)

"They can range from two to three feet depending on the layer, especially when you're in a condensed space."

**Minimum workable bed:** "This can be done in as small as a 5-foot bed."

**Deep buffer (her own yard):** 16 to 18 feet deep, allowing for full front-to-back layering with staggered row depths.

**Narrow beds (6 ft or less):** Use vertical plants (Podocarpus, which "can be 10 feet tall and 1 foot wide") and stone pathways instead of trying to squeeze layers.

**Width of looping beds:** Front-yard loops typically range from 5 feet at their narrowest to 10-11 feet at their widest, with curves that "swoop in" and "pop back out."

**Maintenance access:** Always leave 2 feet behind the deepest tier for a maintenance path. "So you can maintain from the rear side of the planting bed and not be on your neighbor's property."

## 11. Transitions Between Plant Groupings

Transitions are handled through four primary techniques:

**a) The drift-and-break method:** One swath of a plant variety stops, a visual "break" occurs (a boulder, an accent, or simply a gap of mulch), then the next drift begins. "Do one swath, stop it, and do another swath and then stop."

**b) Color-partner threading:** Repeat the same color tones across different plant species as you move through a bed. "Instead of using the same type of plants over and over again, sometimes it's just best to use the same variations of color."

**c) Shared accent connector:** Place an accent plant (False Agave, King Sago, boulder) at the junction between two drifts to tie them together: "I have them framed around a boulder on both sides."

**d) Ground cover continuity:** Run a consistent low ground cover (Blue My Mind, Gold Mound, Liriope) all along the front edge to unify disparate groupings behind it. "Just about every bed back here has a little touch of Blue My Mind. We did not go crazy, but it just has a little bit of that blue color" threading the entire space together.

**Zigzag transitions at entrance points:** "Take that same planting bed and stagger it. Instead of it being right across from each other at your entrance way, stagger it forward. One pushed back, one pulled forward."

## 12. The "Skirt Everything" Rule

Any plant or tree that develops a leggy, bare base must be concealed with a lower planting in front -- the "skirt."

**The rule:** "You always have to have a skirt planting mostly with Crotons."

**Why:** "While they're young, they're going to have a little bit of legginess to them. They will eventually fill out, but you'll notice that's why I love to put skirt plantings. Anytime I know that we're going to have a lapse of time with some legginess at the base, you want something to the front of them."

**Common skirt plants:**
- Sanchezia: "If you need a skirt, they're a fantastic skirt... so thick, so dense, and they do a great job of kind of camouflaging anything behind it."
- Foxtail Ferns: Commonly used as a skirt, especially around boulders and accents.
- Burle Marx Philodendron: "A gorgeous bedding... they kind of cascade over and cluster together."
- Blue My Mind, Gold Mound, Dwarf Ixora: Low growers for the front-most skirt tier.
- Carissa Boxwood: Used in the front tier for compact green skirting.

**Skirt depth:** Typically 2 to 3 feet of planting in front of the leggy element: "I want a skirt planting here about 3 feet."

**Goal of skirting:** The trunks of tall palms become invisible behind lush bush-height plantings: "The trunks will be covered by all this lush plant material, but the canopies will be what's covering the house from view."

## 13. Nip-Don't-Hack Pruning Philosophy

The designer advocates hand pruning over hedge-trimmer shearing, and emphasizes restraint in pruning frequency.

**Hand pruning over hedge trimmers:** "The way that we do it is hand pruning, hand trimming, hand shaping... when you come through with a hedge trimmer then you're pretty much just cutting those top edges of each plant and I'm telling you that look -- it leaves all those brown edges and tips and leaves it susceptible to pest and bugs and disease."

**Pruning schedule:** Every 60 to 90 days (quarterly), in March, June, September, and December. "Those are the time frames where it gives the plant enough time to flush out."

**Over-pruning warning:** "Over-pruning is a thing, you guys... every time that you prune you allow kind of an open sore for disease or pest or bugs to come in."

**Nip-and-walk philosophy:** "I have these felcos in my back pocket and then as I walk through the garden I can't help but nip and trim and just kind of do a little bit of love on my plants and trees because sometimes that's all it takes."

**Nip to shape, not shear:** "All you do is nip these together. You want to let them control and be one solid grouping." For forcing density: "If you just nip off [the top], it forces the plant to go and connect" laterally rather than stretching upward.

**Cut back aggressively when needed, then let it flush:** "Don't be afraid to cut back. Don't be afraid to bring it down really small. If you make a mistake and you end up chopping a side of it off, chop the other side of it off and round it out. Allow it to flush out."

**Shaping goal:** Follow a curved silhouette: "He's really making sure he's kind of following a curved path and all he's doing is trimming the things that are on the outside of that curved path."

## 14. One Accent / Centerpiece Per Vignette

Each distinct section or vignette within a bed should have one clear focal point -- not a competition of multiple accents.

**The principle:** Each bed section gets a single centerpiece (a specialty palm, a sculptural agave, a boulder, a water feature) and everything else supports it. "We have a centerpiece of the boulder and we flanked an agave on either side of those boulders."

**Key focal point:** "Find a key feature. Now, take your time with this because it took me a little while to find what I wanted to become a focal point. It does not have to be big. It can be small like a ponytail palm, like a desert rose."

**Supporting material stays subordinate:** "I don't want any of this material to overtake the False Agave. The False Agave is meant to be the star of the show."

**Types of centerpieces used:**
- Silver Bismarck Palm as centerpiece amongst Royal Palms
- False Agave flanked by ground covers
- Coquina boulder framed by Foxtail Ferns and Agave
- Madagascar Palm given "forefront, up-close VIP status"
- Triangle Fan Palm as island bed centerpiece
- King Alexander Palm as structural centerpiece

**Don't compete at the same height:** "Make sure that whatever tree you're starting with is either taller or shorter... make sure it starts out at a different height as the neighboring tree."

## 15. Additional Design Rules and Principles

### Connect Plants Into Masses
"My whole goal is to make six plants look like one plant." Plant close enough that individuals knit together into seamless masses. "Once these connect, you're not mulching in this bed."

### The Green Screen Principle
A dark green backdrop (Clusia hedge, dense foliage wall) makes everything in front of it pop with color. "Anytime you put a green screen next to anything... it brings out the color of everything else. It takes it and really just kind of controls your environment, creates more of a garden setting."

### Match Symmetrical Spaces; Stagger Asymmetrical Ones
"When you have spaces that are equal in sizes and distance, it's better off just to kind of work with what you have" -- mirror the planting. But for entrance flanks or unequal sides, stagger them for interest.

### Framing, Not Hiding, the House
"When I put material to the front of a house, it's usually tall, linear, long." Put weight and depth at the corners, keep the front of the house open. "You're framing it, not that you're hiding it."

### The 80/20 Tree-to-Shrub Ratio
"If you can do like an 80% count when it comes to your trees -- your tall trees, your accent trees, your wall -- that's going to give you less work or less care in the garden because those things need to be trimmed more like biannually, versus shrubs or plants need to be trimmed more often."

### Every Plant Needs a Color Partner
"Almost every plant in here has a color partner. So that way when you look at the whole bed, it doesn't feel like you have all the same plants in one bed, but you have the same plant colorations."

### Three Trim Types in One Garden
Structure the garden into three maintenance zones:
1. **Roof-line canopy trees** -- trimmed biannually (palm cleanup)
2. **Privacy walls** (Clusia, Podocarpus) -- trimmed 2-3 times per year
3. **Tropical shrubs and ground covers** -- hand-pruned quarterly (March, June, September, December)

### Lighting as a Design Layer
"Do a layered lighting effect" -- uplight centerpiece trees, spotlight accent features. Lighting extends the enjoyment of the designed layering into the evening hours.

### Natural Elements Break Up Green
Incorporate non-plant elements (boulders, driftwood, statues, flagstone) to break up expanses of foliage and give the eye "a place to rest." "There's not anything lower maintenance than incorporating some natural material in."
