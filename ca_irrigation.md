## Core Design Philosophy

Valentino's overarching principle is minimal water with maximum health. The goal is never to drench a landscape but to deliver water precisely, evenly, and as infrequently as possible:

> "We want to water as little as possible with everything thriving and not needing more water. For the most part, our goal is deep watering, infrequent watering, and I like this idea where possible of just watering where the plants are."

> "Water as little as possible and have everything healthy and looks good."

He consistently emphasizes that irrigation design is not optional or secondary -- it is one of the most impactful elements in any landscape:

> "One of the most impactful and important elements you design in your landscape and your garden is the irrigation system. And many do it inefficiently and without an understanding of hydraulics."

## Head-to-Head Coverage Principle

This is the single most important technical standard Valentino teaches. Head-to-head coverage means the spray from one sprinkler head reaches all the way to the next physical head -- not just to the edge of the next head's spray pattern:

> "Head-to-head coverage. Not where one sprinkler sprays to the spray of another sprinkler, but the spray of one sprinkler actually sprays to the next sprinkler. That's head-to-head coverage."

> "Head-to-head coverage is when the spray of one sprinkler goes all the way to the head of the next sprinkler."

> "Head-to-head coverage, meaning the spray of one sprays to the head of the next sprinkler, not to the spray of the next sprinkler."

Without it, dry spots are inevitable -- and they cascade into larger problems:

> "The coverage isn't sufficient. So we're after head-to-head coverage. We don't have head-to-head coverage. So you have dry spots. It's usually the reason behind excessive weeds, disease, poor growth on the plants."

For large gear-driven heads (e.g., Irritrol I-20s), Valentino specifies:

> "We want head-to-head coverage so we need spacing between 25 and 30 feet."

**Diagnostic use:** Head-to-head coverage is also a diagnostic tool. When troubleshooting a lawn, Valentino turns on the system and checks coverage first:

> "When we turn on the irrigation plenty moist everywhere no dry spots head-to-head coverage I could tell it wasn't water."

## Zone Separation by Compass Exposure

Different sides of a house receive dramatically different amounts of sunlight and heat. Valentino is adamant that each exposure must be on its own valve so it can be watered independently:

> "If you're growing different kinds of plants in different exposures, it really requires that you separate these areas. For instance, the east side should be watered differently than the south side and the north side should be different than the west side because these areas get different amounts of sun and require different amounts of water."

> "You don't put more water than you need on the north side and at the same time you're applying it to the west side of your house. So you need to separate your valve so that you can apply it just what you need."

He extends the principle beyond the four compass points. Different micro-environments within a property each demand their own treatment:

> "Different types of plants require different kinds of water and raised planters are different. A vegetable garden is different. So all of this requires some separation. Separate the valves, have a controller that you can apply water on certain days for certain things."

> "That's one of the things that you need to be sensitive to is the different exposures -- try to put those on valves where you can separate them."

---

## Separate Zones by Plant Type

Beyond compass orientation, Valentino insists on separating zones by plant category. Each of these should have its own valve and schedule:

| Zone Type | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| **Turf / Lawn** | Needs frequent, even coverage; different schedule than shrubs |
| **Ornamental shrubs** | Less water than turf; varies by species |
| **Raised planters** | Drain faster; need more frequent watering; often drip |
| **Vegetable garden** | Heavy water users (e.g., tomatoes every other day); separate feeding needs |
| **Xeriscape / drought-tolerant** | Minimal water once established; drip only |

> "Raised planters are different. A vegetable garden is different. So all of this requires some separation."

For new plantings, even drought-tolerant gardens need temporary supplemental water:

> "When it's first planted even a xeriscape or water efficient garden they have to branch out into the soil the roots do, so it's difficult to go immediately into water conserving mode. You do much more frequent waterings although it doesn't have to be real deep watering."

## Hydraulics and Pipe Sizing

Valentino considers this the most misunderstood topic in irrigation. Pressure -- not volume -- is the key to a well-functioning system:

> "To really know how to design an irrigation system is to understand pressure. Pressure is key. Pressure is more valuable than diamonds."

The common mistake is reducing pipe diameter at the end of a run to "increase pressure." This is exactly wrong:

> "Almost all professionals, if they don't really understand irrigation design, they say, 'Oh, we want to make it smaller at the end to increase the pressure.' ... That is 100% wrong. You do increase velocity, but you decrease pressure."

> "The only reason you use smaller pipe is not to increase pressure. It's to save money because the smaller pipe is a lot less expensive than a big pipe."

Valentino's practical rule for homeowners:

> "We have a rule. We never use half inch pipe because there's not a big difference in cost between half inch and 3/4 and we're safer by just ending everything in three quarter pipe."

The design principle is about minimizing friction loss:

> "What irrigation designers that know what they're doing, what they do is they calculate what's the smallest pipe I can put throughout the system that will carry the amount of water that needs to be carried that will have minimal pressure loss due to friction."

**Hiring test:** Valentino suggests asking a prospective contractor how they maximize pressure:

> "If they say, 'I maximize pressure by notching down the size of the pipe,' then they don't really understand pipe sizing and they don't really understand irrigation hydraulics."

## Drip Systems

Valentino has converted his own property entirely from sprinklers to drip and recommends drip for virtually all planting beds:

> "When we first bought this property many years ago, it was virtually all sprinklers. And now it is all drip for a number of reasons, including... we're in an area that gets a lot of drought type weather and we've faced that water shortage here."

### Advantages of Drip

> "The first thing that's a big part of an eco-friendly irrigation system is to not waste water. And one of the most effective systems at doing that is a drip system that delivers water right to the plant and doesn't throw water everywhere and delivers it slowly so it can sink in and not evaporate."

> "Big maintenance saving because you're not throwing water everywhere and you're not going to have weeds everywhere."

### Drawbacks Acknowledged

> "Some people don't like drip irrigation, and it does have its drawbacks. It's probably not the easiest in terms of maintenance, and it's a little hard to tell if it's working properly."

### Types of Drip Systems Used

- **Individual emitters** for specimen plants and trees
- **Tubing with built-in emitters** for ground cover and mass plantings
- **Double-ring drip** for trees (one ring over root ball, a second wider ring for future root growth)

> "The plants are either watered -- it's individual emitters or we have the rows of tubing with the emitters built in where we want ground cover to fill in."

> "We used a double ring of drip irrigation... we put one ring right over the root ball the existing root ball and then we made a bigger ring out a little farther out for as it starts to root. Once these start to grow we might choose to put a third ring."

### Vegetable Garden Drip

For tomatoes, the system uses two emitters per plant:

> "You got two two gallon emitters on every tomato and you're leaving it on how long -- 30 minutes. 30 minutes every other day."

---

## Dog-Proof and Buried Irrigation

Dogs are a common source of irrigation damage. Valentino's solution is to bury the entire drip system:

> "The dog's prone to chewing on or breaking irrigation things that are above grade -- sprinklers and valves and such. You can't see them here. This one is a drip system and it's completely buried. PD doesn't have access to it. They're just under the rock and so you can find the emitters if you want to."

> "That is a way you can get away from dogs that tend to be destructive with irrigation systems is use a buried system and drip lends itself very well to that."

### Buried Systems in Natural Areas

For rural or natural-area plantings where animals chew drip tubing, Valentino uses a different approach -- buried schedule 40 PVC with pop-up heads at each plant:

> "I don't like to use drip tubing because it's really subject to animals eating it and putting holes in it and constantly needing repair. What we came up with is all the pipe is buried and it's all schedule 40 pipe and then when we got to each plant we put it on a regular sprinkler that pops up 4 in when it comes on and is made out of sturdy plastic material so that it's difficult to damage and it's finished to grade so you can't kick it -- it's on a swing joint so even if you were to step on it it won't break."

## Injector Systems for Fertilizer Delivery

For vegetable gardens, Valentino describes an injector that automatically delivers soil amendments through the irrigation line every time the system runs:

> "He has an injector for his vegetable garden where every time it waters it injects whatever he wants it to inject, and we are going to have it inject penetrate liquid bio tiller and then he doesn't have to worry about manually putting it on."

This is described as a practical labor-saving approach for gardens that benefit from weekly liquid applications, eliminating the need for manual spray schedules.

---

## Smart Controllers and Weather-Based Systems

Valentino recommends weather-connected controllers over soil sensors:

> "A mechanism to make sure that you apply water as needed. Many have come on the market recently. I like the ones connected to weather data. So it analyzes your local weather and based on the kind of weather you're having. If it's raining, your system turns off automatically. And if it's 100 degrees, you're watering more. All the major manufacturers make products like that. Hunter, Rainbird, Toro."

> "There's also products made to connect your system to soil sensors. I'm less fond of soil sensors. To me, they're more complicated to install and to use."

He also emphasizes automated systems with battery backup:

> "Having an automated system that's very dependable, with even a backup battery when we have power failures at least helps to keep the regulation of the distribution of water consistent."

---

## Watering Schedules by Season and Plant Type

### Timing of Day

The single best time to water is early morning, just before or as the sun rises:

> "If you have a choice, we want you to water real early in the morning just before the sun comes out or as the sun is coming out. That makes it so that the water doesn't sit around all night, which is something that causes fungal problems."

> "When you water at night, it stands around until the sun comes out. A better strategy, if it's possible, is to water right when the sun is coming up or right before the sun comes up because you put on all the water that you need and then the sun dries it up and it's not standing."

### New Plantings (First Year)

> "We planted it in June and it was very hot it was 100 degrees when we planted it and so we watered every day and now slowly we're toning down that watering and we're down to every other day. Probably in another couple of weeks be every third or fourth day."

### Established Shrubs

> "On a garden like this I think the lawn is being watered twice a week and most of the shrubs once a week now that they've been in a couple of years. But in the first year they were being watered every day in the first few weeks and then every other day."

### Vegetables (Tomatoes in Zone 9 Summer)

> "Right now you're watering every other day... you got two two gallon emitters on every tomato and you're leaving it on how long -- 30 minutes. 30 minutes every other day."

### Fruit Trees with Basins

> "I think we could get by even on these 100 degree days with just twice a week watering -- Tuesday and Saturday."

For newly planted fruit trees, deep soaking is key:

> "We've been watering 26 minutes and that isn't enough. I want to fill the basins more."

The final timing was approximately one hour per basin.

### Lawn (Fresno Seasonal Calendar)

- **Summer:** Varies by system quality and soil; typically 2-3 times per week
- **Fall (November 1):** Once per week
- **Winter (December 1 to March 1):** Irrigation off in Fresno

> "Here in Fresno on November 1 we can only water once a week which will probably be fine. Usually I say by December one you can turn off the irrigation usually till about March 1 because we have some moisture in the air and we have some rain."

### Deep and Infrequent Principle

> "Into the second year and we can start watering less frequently and more deeply to try to encourage deep rooting which would allow us to not have to water as much."

### The Soil-Probe Method

Rather than relying on meters, Valentino recommends physically checking soil moisture:

> "I prefer more of a soil probe where you dig down and sample the soil at an inch below and two and three and four and 5 in below and you look into how much water is being applied or the weather conditions. Then you put all of these things together and determine if it's from underwatering or overwatering."

## Professional Installation Costs

Valentino is candid about the cost and strongly discourages DIY irrigation design:

> "If you hire a licensed contractor, it really is going to vary, but probably somewhere in the $2 to $3 a square foot range. So, if you have say 1,500 square ft front yard, you know, you're around $5,000. It's an expensive job with expensive materials and if you don't do it properly and have to redo it, there's significant costs to that."

> "One where it really doesn't work -- installing your own irrigation system. More and more irrigation systems in order to perform properly are pretty sophisticated installation proposals. And so I frequently discourage people from installing their own irrigation system or for sure discourage them from designing their own irrigation system."

## Common Irrigation Mistakes

### 1. No Head-to-Head Coverage

> "I see I would say every day in the summer problems with the irrigation system. The coverage isn't sufficient. So we're after head-to-head coverage. We don't have head-to-head coverage. So you have dry spots."

### 2. All Zones on One Schedule

> "It might be tempting to just throw water everywhere if you're trying to irrigate and because that is inexpensive and it's the simplest way. But if you're growing different kinds of plants in different exposures, it really requires that you separate these areas."

### 3. Watering at the Wrong Time

> "The perfect time to water is very early in the morning, right before the sun comes out, and then finish the watering as the sun's coming out. ... Water standing around is what creates fungal disease in the summer."

### 4. Overwatering

> "What most people overdo in their yards? ... Actually it's watering. Doing too much watering is a very common problem and a problem that leads to all kinds of ramifications. Too much weed growth, too many pests and diseases, poor performance of plants. Nothing can kill a plant faster than too much water."

> "Lots of potted plants die from overwatering."

### 5. Compensating for Bad Coverage by Running Longer

> "A lot of times that happens because you have this problem area. It's always dry and so you think I got to water longer. I got to water longer. And while you're watering longer, you have these other areas that do cover fine and now they get too much water."

### 6. Reducing Pipe Size to "Boost" Pressure

> "Almost all professionals, if they don't really understand irrigation design, they say, 'Oh, we want to make it smaller at the end to increase the pressure.' ... That is 100% wrong."

### 7. Using Half-Inch Pipe

> "We have a rule. We never use half inch pipe because there's not a big difference in cost between half inch and 3/4 and we're safer by just ending everything in three quarter pipe."

### 8. Keeping Spray Systems on Xeriscape Conversions

> "Don't keep your same sprinkler system that threw water everywhere on your lawn. Instead, use something water efficient that delivers water directly to the plant."

### 9. Turning Nozzle Breakup Screws Down Instead of Fixing Coverage

> "This dry area here you might be tempted to put a nozzle and turn the breakup screw way down since it's so close to the sprinkler but that's not how you do it. What you do is you get all the sprinklers working properly and you get all these sprinklers around it spraying into this area."

### 10. Neglecting System Monitoring

> "The laziest way is to have a good quality, properly installed and well-managed irrigation system. You do have to monitor it or somebody has to monitor it."

> "The timing doesn't have a simple answer -- you're probably going to be able to be better at it than anybody as long as you're paying attention and you're looking at the results."

## MP Rotators and Retrofits

When a full system replacement is not feasible, Valentino recommends MP rotators as a high-value retrofit:

> "These heads, they're called MP rotators. They could just retrofit a system because they use a lot less water than most and they'll allow you to throw water just as far or farther. So have better coverage even as a retrofit. If you don't want to replace everything, you could just replace the sprinkler heads and sometimes even just the nozzles cuz it comes in a simple nozzle."

The key benefit is pressure conservation:

> "A head like the MP rotator allows you to use small amounts of water, which will boost your pressure. If you're using 25 gallons a minute and then you change your heads and now you're using 12 gallons a minute, you'll see your pressure is way, way better. And if our pressure is good, then our coverage is more even."

For lawns, he also recommends 6-inch pop-ups over shorter ones:

> "One improvement that we made is we put in 6-in pop-ups. And you can see how they pop way up over the lawn. Over time, the sprinklers kind of low. If they only pop up 2, three, or 4 in, the blades of the grass will block them."
