## Tree Selection Philosophy

John Valentino's core principle is simple: **the right tree for the right space**. Choosing a tree that fits the site prevents broken pipes, damaged roofs, damaged foundations, heaved concrete, and cracked walkways -- problems that cost thousands to repair.

> "Have you ever seen a tree at the nursery and immediately fell in love with it and think, 'That's it. That's the one.' And five years later, it looks like you're living in the shadow of a skyscraper."

> "Nothing makes a more high-maintenance landscape than inappropriately sized trees."

> "I've been a landscape contractor and landscape architect for 46 years now. And I've seen just about every mistake under the sun."

### Key Selection Criteria

| Factor | What to Consider |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Canopy size** | Will it outgrow the lot? A 25-ft canopy tree 5 ft from the fence will impose on neighbors |
| **Root habits** | Will roots crack driveways, sidewalks, foundations? |
| **Lot size** | Small lots need patio-scale trees; large lots can handle shade trees |
| **Sun exposure** | South- and west-facing sites get baked in summer; trees can shade the house |
| **Neighbor impact** | Canopy overhanging fences, debris dropping into neighbor's pool |
| **Insurance concerns** | Insurance companies are tightening on branches touching the roof |

> "The two big things to picking the right tree are the canopy size and the habits of the roots."

> "If you plant a large tree with big roots and a big canopy, you limit your ability to have other plantings because that tree dominates to where it's pretty much the only thing you can grow."

---

## The Value of Trees

John strongly emphasizes that trees are long-term investments that appreciate in value:

> "Mature trees in a well-landscaped yard increase home values by 7 to 19%, and that's by records of home sales. They also remove pollutants and sequester carbon."

> "If you plant the right tree in the right place that screens western and southern sun, they save $6 to $270 per tree in energy bills."

> "As trees grow, they become more valuable. So if you're not caring for the trees properly, then you're risking losing value."

---

## Trees for Small Sites & Patios

For typical subdivision lots (which John notes are "small these days"), the recommendation is **patio-scale trees** -- trees that stay proportional to the space and don't cause root damage.

> "For small lots, we like to plant small trees, what we call patio scale trees, so that we can do other types of planting and create gardens that aren't one-dimensional with one massive tree that's causing all kinds of problems."

> "Almost every normal-sized tree, meaning 25 feet tall and wide or bigger, is too big for a site like this."

### Recommended Patio-Scale Trees

| Tree | Size / Notes |
|------|-------------|
| **Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum)** | 3-30 ft depending on variety; dwarf varieties 3-5 ft; green forms tolerate more sun in Fresno |
| **Hibiscus syriacus** (Rose of Sharon) | Can be pruned into a "lollipop tree" with ~10-ft canopy; stays well-behaved near pools |
| **Crepe Myrtle** (smaller varieties) | Many smaller varieties available; Lagerstroemia |
| **Little Ragu Bay** (dwarf bay laurel) | Only 5-6 ft tall vs. 20-30 ft for full-size bay; prune once/year for shape |
| **Eastern / Western Redbud** (Cercis) | Small deciduous tree; good patio scale; fantastic spring bloom |
| **Arbutus 'Marina'** (Strawberry Tree) | 15-20 ft tall; good for small lots; does well in Fresno |
| **Raphiolepis 'Majestic Beauty'** | Small evergreen flowering tree; no root problems; good for tight spaces near paving |
| **Dwarf Ginkgo** ('Jade Butterfly') | Grows slowly; only ~10 ft tall; dramatic fall color |
| **Fruitless Olive** (multi-trunk) | Can branch out over walkways; well-behaved roots |
| **Little Ollie** (dwarf olive) | Normally a shrub, can be trained as a small patio tree |

> "These kinds of trees I call lollipop trees because you can train them and get them started and then they're really not that labor intensive. But the scale of this tree to my smaller yard gives me a lot of beauty without being overly large and looking out of place."

### Shrubs Trained as Small Patio Trees

John advocates taking shrubs and training them into tree form for very small gardens:

> "You can take a plant that's really not very big and turn it into a small patio tree... you can do that with all kinds of shrubs -- photinia, xylosma, and you can even do it with lantana and gardenias."

---

## Shade Trees for Large Lots

For properties with ample space, larger shade trees are appropriate and valuable for cooling the home:

> "They wanted large trees that would shade the house over time."

### Large Shade Trees Suitable for Central California

| Tree | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Keith Davey Chinese Pistache** | Grafted variety; guarantees spectacular fall color; no berries; very well-behaved; ~25 ft canopy; one of the best shade trees for the area |
| **Southern Live Oak** | Large; strong trunk often doesn't need staking; evergreen |
| **Chinese Elm** | "A big tree that grows like crazy"; park-scale tree |
| **California Sycamore** | Big shade tree; provides significant canopy |
| **Camphor** | Park-scale tree; too big for small lots |
| **River Birch 'Dura Heat'** | Good shade from western sun; deciduous (allows winter light); well-behaved, no root problems |

> "One of the best shade trees for our area in that it's very well behaved -- it's a type of Chinese pistache called Keith Davey. The fall color is just starting... and by grafting it you guarantee a certain fall color, guarantee no berries, and guarantee this kind of maintenance-free tree."

---

## Ornamental Trees

### Crepe Myrtle (Lagerstroemia)

Crepe myrtles come in many sizes and are a favorite for the Central Valley:

**Indian Tribe varieties** (large crepe myrtles):
- **Tuscarora** -- Big plumes of flowers; excellent small shade tree
- **Muskogee** -- Large-scale crepe myrtle
- **Natchez** -- White multi-trunk; used in designed gardens

> "Crepe myrtles like this Tuscarora and like this Muskogee -- those are big crepe myrtles and they're called Indian Tribe crepe myrtles. They're big and they have these big plumes of flowers. This makes an excellent small shade tree."

**Care notes:**
- Thinning once a year recommended for best appearance
- Multi-trunk forms don't need staking
- Aphids can be an issue; address through soil health
- Some varieties are smaller and ideal for tight spaces

### Redbud (Cercis)

Multiple varieties recommended for California gardens:

| Variety | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Oklahoma Redbud** | ~$800 for 36-in box; stays small; good patio-scale tree; fantastic spring bloom |
| **Flamethrower Redbud** | Colorful leaves year-round plus spring bloom; fabulous cultivar |
| **Rising Sun Redbud** | Nice fall color; attractive year-round |
| **Eastern Redbud** | Small deciduous tree or large deciduous shrub |
| **Western Redbud** | California native; suitable for hot, dry Mediterranean climate |

> "Western Redbuds and Eastern Redbuds, which are similar in size and bloom, are all small deciduous trees or large deciduous shrubs, so there's lots of appropriate applications for them in gardens. We're always looking for small trees that don't have damaging roots, don't require a lot of space, can shade western sun."

### Dogwood (Cornus)

John grows and uses dogwoods even in Fresno's heat, though they need some protection:

| Variety | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Cornus kousa** (Korean Dogwood) | Used as a centerpiece tree at the Fresno Chaffee Zoo; three planted together to create multi-trunk effect |
| **Cornus florida** (Flowering Dogwood) | Pink and white varieties; blooms earlier in spring than kousa |
| **Mountain Moon Dogwood** | Less common variety; available in 5-gallon |

> "The whole goal when this project started was to have a big spectacular tree here... it was determined that a really good and somewhat unique choice is this Cornus kousa, which is Korean Dogwood."

One garden owner has eight dogwoods of various varieties, plus two in the backyard -- a dedicated "Dogwoods" cottage garden.

### Smoke Tree / Smoke Bush (Cotinus)

> "In the courtyard we have red Japanese maple in the corner, an interesting smoke tree."

- Dwarf smoke bush used in courtyard gardens alongside Japanese maples, Eastern redbud, and lamb's ear
- Works well in designed intimate garden spaces

### Chinese Pistache (Keith Davey)

One of John's most frequently recommended trees:

> "Keith Davey Chinese pistache -- Chinese pistache that's grafted so that it doesn't have berries and guarantees the fall color. Spectacular fall color."

- Grafted variety ensures consistent performance
- No messy berries
- Orangish-reddish fall leaf color
- Very well-behaved roots
- Note: Even the well-behaved Chinese pistache may be too big for very small lots

---

## Evergreen vs. Deciduous Considerations

John considers both types essential, selected based on the site's needs:

### Deciduous Trees -- Advantages
- Allow winter light through windows when leaves drop
- Provide summer shade when needed most
- Many offer fall color (pistache, maples, ginkgo, sweetgum)
- Fruit trees are deciduous

> "Since it's a west-facing exposure, we still wanted to provide a lot of shade. River Birch 'Dura Heat' -- nice shade from the western sun, and yet it'll allow light in in the winter because it does drop its leaves."

### Evergreen Trees -- Advantages
- Year-round screening and privacy
- Constant visual structure
- Good for windbreaks

**Evergreen tree examples:**
- Southern Live Oak
- Raphiolepis 'Majestic Beauty' (small evergreen flowering tree)
- Fruitless Olive
- Japanese Blueberry
- Osmanthus fragrans (fragrant evergreen screen)

> "The Oaks -- not Evergreen Oaks but deciduous Oaks -- which are all over the country usually have nice fall color."

---

## Fall Color Trees

John provides a comprehensive list for zones that don't naturally get great fall color (like Fresno):

| Tree | Fall Color |
|------|-----------|
| **Keith Davey Chinese Pistache** | Spectacular orangish-reddish |
| **Chinese Tallow** | "Probably one of the best fall colors here" |
| **Ginkgo** | Tremendous; bright yellow; drops leaves all at once ("puddle of gold") |
| **American Sweetgum (Liquidambar)** | Fantastic; cultivar 'Palo Alto' and others |
| **Tulip Tree (Liriodendron tulipifera)** | Subtle yellow fall color |
| **Japanese Maple** | Almost all varieties turn some color in fall; can be spectacular |
| **Deciduous Oaks** | Nice fall color across the country |
| **Redbud 'Rising Sun'** | Nice fall color; attractive year-round |
| **Autumn Fantasy Maple** | Available in 15-gallon; nice variety |

> "If you're interested in buying and planting anything because fall color is one of your main interests, then it's very smart to buy it in the fall. You can see exactly what the fall color is... because some of them, like even a Chinese pistache, you can get a dud."

## Tree Size Guide

### Container Sizes and Pricing (Fresno, CA area)

| Container Size | Typical Tree Height | Approximate Cost | Best For |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **5-gallon** | 3-4 ft | $30-50 | Budget planting; patient gardeners |
| **15-gallon** | ~7 ft tall, 2-3 ft canopy | $80-100 | Standard residential planting; best value |
| **24-inch box** | 8-12 ft | $200-400 | Faster impact |
| **36-inch box** | 12-16 ft | ~$800 | Significant immediate presence |
| **48-inch box** | 16-20+ ft | ~$2,000 | Instant mature look |

> "In terms of the health of the plant, it's really the smaller the plant the better. Also way less expensive. You saw we were looking at $800 to $2,000 trees and you can buy the exact same tree for $75 to $100 but in a smaller container."

> "Usually you can get to the next size in about one year in the ground."

### Tree to Lot Size Matching

| Lot Type | Recommended Tree Scale | Examples |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Small subdivision lot** | Patio-scale (10-15 ft canopy) | Japanese maple, redbud, hibiscus tree, Little Ragu bay, crepe myrtle (smaller varieties) |
| **Medium lot** | Medium shade trees (15-25 ft canopy) | Keith Davey Chinese pistache, Natchez crepe myrtle, River Birch 'Dura Heat' |
| **Large lot / estate** | Full shade trees (25+ ft canopy) | Southern Live Oak, California Sycamore, Chinese Elm, camphor |
| **Near pool** | Non-messy patio trees | Hibiscus tree, fruitless olive; avoid trees that drop debris |
| **Near paving/foundation** | Well-behaved roots only | Redbud, Japanese maple, crepe myrtle, Raphiolepis |

## Proper Planting Technique

### Hole Preparation

**Width: 2 to 2.5 times the root ball**

> "Regardless of the depth, you want to dig the hole very, very wide. So you want to go two to 2 and 1/2 times the width of the root ball."

> "We would dig a hole that's about twice the size of the container."

**Depth: Match the root ball -- never too deep**

> "You don't necessarily need to dig it deep. You could just dig it the proper depth and not subject to settling on the bottom."

> "We would not dig it deep because when we dig it deep, that allows for settling over time."

> "We want to plant them a little bit high -- to where this root ball can be, well, a half an inch to an inch high above grade."

If you encounter hard/compacted soil (hard pan), break through it:

> "We don't want to set the tree on something real hard. We want to break that up."

### Backfill: Use Native Soil

**Do NOT use bulk amendment in the backfill.** This is a point John emphasizes repeatedly and says soil scientists and arborists agree on:

> "All soil scientists and arborists agree that it isn't beneficial to use a lot of bulk amendment in the back fill because we want trees to root out into their native soil. We usually recommend using the native soil so we don't have a difference in texture."

> "Some are tempted to dig this hole and then put brand new beautiful soil in there that's completely different than the native soil. I don't recommend that."

### Avoiding the "Bathtub Effect"

When you create a planting hole with amended soil that differs dramatically from the surrounding native soil, you create an interface where roots won't cross and water won't drain properly:

> "You're creating what is sometimes called the bathtub effect where you've got a hole that is a certain texture and a certain quality of soil and then you create an interface where that meets up with the native soil and the plants won't root out into that."

> "That just sits there and roots won't go into it. Water won't go out of it. We're trying to get this tree to root into the native soil."

### Biological Amendments (Not Bulk Soil Amendment)

While John advises against replacing native soil with amended soil, he strongly recommends adding **biological soil amendments** to the backfill:

- **Mycorrhizae** -- should be touching the roots directly
- **Beneficial bacteria and fungi** (via products like Maximize)
- **Nourish Biosol** -- cultured soybean/cottonseed meal bloom for feeding soil life
- **Penetrate Liquid Bio Tiller** -- sprayed generously on root ball and basin after planting

> "Now we've got mycorrhizae and all our other things actually touching the roots."

> "Maximize -- that's the one that actually has soil life in it. It has beneficial bacteria and fungi, including the most famous fungi, mycorrhizae."

### Planting Depth -- The Critical Rule

> "The most common improper planting that is really bad for plants... is when they're buried too deeply. Optimal height is whatever the stem and top of root ball height is when you buy the plant from the nursery. Keep that and maybe even plant that half an inch or an inch higher than the finished grade."

> "One of the most important things on plants and trees is not to allow them to settle below grade where water can collect around the base of the tree."

### Preventing Settling

The City of Fresno takes settling so seriously they require a 20-day waiting period:

> "When we plant a tree for the city of Fresno, drilling or some large excavation is required and a waiting period of 20 days is required. Sounds a little severe to have to wait 20 days to plant the tree, but that reflects the seriousness of the problem."

> "Settling is when the tree sinks below the grade, almost like dropping into a hole. Then whenever it rains or even when you water, water collects around the base of the trunk. And there's nothing worse for a tree than water collecting around it."

**Prevention methods:**
1. Don't dig deeper than necessary
2. If you dig deep, settle the backfill completely with water before planting
3. Plant slightly high (1/2 to 1 inch above grade)
4. Compact the bottom of the hole before placing the root ball

### Dealing with Circling Roots

> "If you have a plant that's been in a container too long and they're circling roots, growing around each other and there's not a lot of soil in there -- it's like a potbound plant. You don't recognize that and you don't, in the process of planting it, kind of separate the roots and encourage it to root out into the native soil. That can also cause a problem."

When inspecting at the nursery, look for girdling roots:

> "One thing they will look for is a rooting like this. This kind of rooting is a problem. We don't want roots that are growing around the tree. We want the roots to go out."

---

## Staking Methods

### Why Proper Staking Matters

The nursery stake (tied directly to the trunk) must be removed and replaced with proper staking that allows movement:

> "You get your tree from the nursery with this stake usually tied directly to it, and that really isn't good for the tree. The nurseries need to do it because they don't want to sell crooked trees and straight trees are desirable and preferred in most cases."

> "If you were to leave that stake on the tree -- it's tied directly to the trunk. It inhibits the movement of the tree. And it's that very movement that allows trees to develop the kind of tensile strength starting at the bottom right around the soil that will allow them to stand on their own over time."

### The Goal: Tensile Strength and Independence

> "Tensile strength is when the trunk is wider at its base than it is 1, 2, 3, and 4 feet high. And that really is our goal. We don't want trees that are permanently staked. We want trees that after a year or two, all stakes can be removed."

> "If anyone asks you what's the most important thing in staking -- how do you stake a tree properly -- the most important factor is movement."

### Proper Staking Procedure

1. **Remove the nursery stake** tied directly to the trunk (if the tree is strong enough)
2. **Use two stakes** placed at equal height on opposite sides of the tree
3. **Orient stakes perpendicular to the prevailing wind** so the wind blows between the stakes, not into them
4. **Use flexible tree ties** tied in a figure-eight pattern
5. **Tie placement:** Grab the trunk and find where you can hold it upright; go 6 inches above that point
6. **Tie position:** About 6 inches below the top of the stakes
7. **Optional:** Additional flexible ties lower on the trunk can straighten a curve

> "This is how you stake it to have movement when the wind blows. We have two stakes and then we have two flexible ties."

> "Professional staking is when the stakes end up being exactly the same height. And the ties, in my opinion, should be just about 6 inches below the top of the stakes."

> "I really believe firmly you should orient the stakes so that the prevailing wind direction is perpendicular to the stakes. So not where the wind blows into one of the stakes, but stakes on either side of the tree and then the wind comes -- because that way you can get the most movement."

### When Three Stakes Are Needed

> "We have this photo here showing a tree that fell over even with two stakes. And now with three stakes, we have it extremely stable and still able to move because we use flexible tree ties in a figure eight."

### Stake Removal Timing

- **Remove the nursery support stake** as soon as the tree is planted with proper staking (if strong enough)
- **Remove all staking** after 1-2 years when the trunk has developed tensile strength (wider at base)

> "If you take this support stake off now and then retie these, you'll get a little more movement when the wind blows... and then the next year you can take these stakes off and you've got these nice straight strong trees."

> "It's better if you don't need to stake the tree. It's much healthier for the tree."

### Trees That Usually Don't Need Staking

- **Multi-trunk trees** (fruitless olives, multi-trunk crepe myrtles)
- **Southern Live Oak** (often has a strong enough trunk already)
- Trees with a wide, low base

> "Multi-trunks don't usually need staking. The crepe myrtle multi -- you don't need staking because they don't have a tall thin trunk with a bunch of weight on top."

---

## Watering After Planting

### Initial Establishment

> "Right after planting, it needs more water than it normally would need."

> "In the first day, it's impossible to overwater. Not even in the second or the third day."

### The Overwatering Danger

> "After about a week, the tendency is to look at the trees and if they just don't look quite as perky as you would like... the first thing you can think of since it's hot and you're hot and everything seems miserable -- 'Hey, let's water them.' I think that's what happened to the one tree that died."

> "That combination of heat and overwatering -- the soil's saturated, there's a lack of air in the soil, it becomes anaerobic. That can kill trees and new plants faster than anything."

### Tapering Schedule (Summer Planting Example)

When planting in extreme heat (100+ degrees):
1. **Days 1-3:** Water heavily; impossible to overwater
2. **First week:** Water daily
3. **Weeks 2-3:** Every other day
4. **Weeks 3-5:** Every third or fourth day
5. **Long-term:** Deep watering twice per week (e.g., Tuesday and Saturday)

> "We watered every day and now slowly we're toning down that watering. We're down to every other day. Probably in another couple of weeks, every third or fourth day."

### Standing Water Warning

> "One of the worst things for trees is standing water in saturated soil, particularly with high temperatures."

Basins are useful right after planting but should be removed if in a rainy area or if water sits too long.

## Species-Specific Notes

### Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum)

John's most extensively discussed ornamental tree. He installed a garden with 10 different dwarf Japanese maples in a small Fresno backyard.

**Size range:**
- Dwarf: 3-5 ft (dissectum, Peeves Starfish, Tamokiyama, Ryusei)
- Medium: 5-12 ft (Johin, Fireglow, Shaina)
- Large: 20-30 ft (Sango Kaku, standard green)

**Leaf types:** Maple leaf, ribbon leaf, lace leaf (dissected)

**Leaf colors:** Orange, purple, red, green, yellow -- most colorful in spring and fall; color fades in mid-summer heat.

**Bark:** Some varieties have spectacular bark (Sango Kaku = coral bark -- "beautiful bark that adds to the attraction of the tree even in the winter when it doesn't have any leaves").

**Sun/shade needs:**
> "All of the leaves that are more finely divided and more delicate tend to be more sensitive to sun. Make sure it doesn't get much or any afternoon sun."

> "This green one takes quite a lot of sun, doesn't have invasive roots."

**Water:** Prefer slightly moist soil, especially in sun. "In the summer, if you're trying to keep them looking good and not burning, then you want to make sure those roots stay moist."

**Care:** Thin once a year; prune to reveal structure. "I like the idea of keeping them thinned."

**Planting zones:** Most parts of the country can grow Japanese maples. There are 300-400 varieties.

**Named varieties mentioned:**
- Dissectum, Dissectum Viridis (green lace-leaf, 3 ft)
- Johin (10-12 ft; means "lady-like" in Japanese)
- Shaina (spectacular colors)
- Fireglow (dwarf red)
- Peeves Starfish (dwarf red)
- Tamokiyama
- Ryusei (weeping dwarf; acts like ground cover)
- Sango Kaku (25 ft; coral bark; too large for small gardens)

### Keith Davey Chinese Pistache

> "If you buy the Keith Davey, which is a grafted one, you're kind of guaranteed this spectacular orangish-reddish leaf color in the fall."

- Grafted = guaranteed fall color, no berries, well-behaved
- 25-ft canopy -- too big for very small lots but excellent for medium-to-large properties
- One of the most recommended shade trees for the Central Valley

### River Birch 'Dura Heat'

- Deciduous -- provides summer shade, allows winter light
- Well-behaved roots; no root problems
- Good for west-facing exposures
- Used in lines along walkways for shade effect

### Crepe Myrtle (General Notes)

- Available in many sizes from small shrubs to large trees
- Indian Tribe varieties (Tuscarora, Muskogee, Natchez) are the large ones
- Multi-trunk forms don't need staking
- Aphids can be addressed through healthy soil, not chemicals
- Lots of crepe myrtles used throughout Fresno landscapes

### Redbud (Cercis -- General Notes)

- Native option: Western Redbud (California native; thrives without summer water once established)
- Small deciduous tree or large deciduous shrub
- "We're always looking for small trees that don't have damaging roots, don't require a lot of space."
- For native plantings, water the first two years to establish, then reduce or eliminate supplemental water

### Dogwood (Cornus)

- **Cornus kousa** (Korean/Japanese Dogwood): Blooms later in spring than Florida varieties; used as centerpiece tree
- **Cornus florida** (Flowering Dogwood): Blooms earlier in spring; white and pink varieties
- Can grow in Fresno but need protection from excessive heat
- Shade is beneficial

### Smoke Tree / Smoke Bush (Cotinus)

- Dwarf smoke bush used in courtyard and intimate garden settings
- Pairs well with Japanese maples, redbuds, and other ornamentals
- Interesting foliage and "smoke" flower effect

### Fruitless Olive

- Available as multi-trunk or standard
- Multi-trunks don't need staking
- Well-behaved roots
- Good screening/structure tree
- Pruning: Thinning to maintain look

### Southern Live Oak

- Large evergreen shade tree
- Often has such a strong trunk that staking is unnecessary
- Significant canopy; suitable only for larger properties

## Common Tree Planting Mistakes

Based on John Valentino's 46 years of experience, here are the most common and most costly mistakes:

### 1. Planting Too Deep

> "The most common improper planting that is really bad for plants is when they're buried too deeply."

Always keep the root flare visible and slightly above grade.

### 2. Allowing Settling

> "Settling is when the tree sinks below the grade, almost like dropping into a hole."

Dig the hole to proper depth only; settle backfill before planting if the hole is deep.

### 3. Creating the Bathtub Effect

> "You're creating what is sometimes called the bathtub effect where you've got a hole that is a certain texture and a certain quality of soil and then you create an interface where that meets up with the native soil and the plants won't root out into that."

Use native soil for backfill, not amended soil.

### 4. Wrong Tree for the Site

> "I saw a Chinese pistachio the other day in my niece's yard, brand new home, and they'd planted it 2 feet from the edge of her roof. Now, that's a 25-ft canopy tree, probably."

> "If you go into new subdivisions, you see all of these big trees planted in these small little yards. They do take over the whole yard and the house."

### 5. Leaving the Nursery Stake On

> "It inhibits the movement of the tree. And it's that very movement that allows trees to develop the kind of tensile strength."

Remove the nursery stake and replace with proper two-stake support.

### 6. Permanent Staking / No Movement

> "We don't want trees that are permanently staked. We want trees that after a year or two, all stakes can be removed."

### 7. Improper Pruning (Heading Back Cuts)

> "If you have a big oak, beautiful oak tree, and you head it back, you really cause problems for the tree down the road because under the cuts sprouts all kinds of new growth. And that new growth, if it's in the middle of a big branch, is very weakly attached. And so now it becomes a dangerous tree."

The proper method is **thinning cuts**, which allow the tree to display its natural beauty.

### 8. Overwatering Newly Planted Trees in Heat

> "That combination of heat and overwatering... the soil's saturated, and there's a lack of air in the soil. It becomes anaerobic. That can kill trees and new plants faster than anything."

### 9. Ignoring Circling / Girdling Roots

> "We don't want roots that are growing around the tree. We want the roots to go out."

Inspect roots when buying and tease out circling roots at planting time.

### 10. Not Mulching

> "Not using mulch is a gardening mistake."

Maintain a 2-inch layer of mulch (double-ground shredded cedar recommended) but keep it away from the trunk.

### 11. Planting Near Draining Pipes with Holes

> "If you have plants nearby, the roots go into those holes and end up plugging up the drainage pipes."

Use solid pipe for drainage near trees.

## Buying Trees at the Nursery

John's guidance for evaluating trees before purchase:

### What to Look For

| Check | What You Want |
|-------|--------------|
| **Trunk** | Straight; not wound around the stake |
| **Graft union** | Above soil level |
| **Surface roots** | No winding/girdling roots around the trunk |
| **Bottom roots** | Young, new-looking roots emerging (good); old, thick circling roots (bad) |
| **Root ball** | Holds together when removed from container; not desiccated |
| **Overall health** | Deep green color; signs of new growth |

> "I would much prefer to plant a tree of this size [15-gallon] and then stake it properly and feed it properly. One thing you want to look for is it's nice to buy them with the trunk straight and not wound around the stake."

> "I look and I see some roots coming out the bottom -- which, as long as they're not big and old-looking -- those are young and new-looking. That's good. I can tell that when I take this out of the container, it's going to hold together."

### Fall Buying Tip

> "If you're interested in buying and planting anything because fall color is one of your main interests, then it's very smart to buy it in the fall. You can see exactly what the fall color is of the plant, because some of them, like even a Chinese pistache, you can get a dud."

### Size vs. Budget Decision

> "In terms of the health of the plant, it's really the smaller the plant the better. Also way less expensive... you can buy the exact same tree for $75 to $100 but in a smaller container. Usually in our area, 15-gallon is the smallest planted and that's a nice size to use."

## Quick Reference: Tree Planting Checklist

1. **Select** the right tree for your lot size, sun exposure, and root space
2. **Dig** the hole 2-2.5x wider than the root ball, no deeper than the root ball
3. **Check** for hard pan beneath; break through if present
4. **Inspect** roots for circling/girdling; tease out if needed
5. **Set** the root ball 1/2 to 1 inch above finished grade
6. **Backfill** with native soil (not amended soil)
7. **Add** mycorrhizae and biological amendments touching the roots
8. **Water** deeply to settle the backfill around roots
9. **Remove** the nursery stake
10. **Install** two stakes perpendicular to prevailing wind with flexible ties in a figure-eight
11. **Mulch** 2 inches deep, keeping mulch away from the trunk
12. **Water** heavily for the first few days, then taper over weeks
13. **Remove** all staking after 1-2 years once tensile strength develops
