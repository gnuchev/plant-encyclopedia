*Note: All light tolerance data is specific to Zone 10A (Vero Beach, FL) conditions. Plants in more northern zones may have different sun/shade requirements. "Afternoon sun" in South Florida is significantly more intense than in temperate climates. Many plants described as "needing protection" specifically need protection from harsh late afternoon (2:00-5:00 PM) summer rays.*
